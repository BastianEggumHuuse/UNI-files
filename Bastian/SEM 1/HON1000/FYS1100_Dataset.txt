Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics (ULNP) publishes authoritative texts covering topics
throughout pure and applied physics. Each title in the series is suitable as a basis for
undergraduate instruction, typically containing practice problems, worked examples, chapter
summaries, and suggestions for further reading.
ULNP titles must provide at least one of the following:
• An exceptionally clear and concise treatment of a standard undergraduate subject.
• A solid undergraduate-level introduction to a graduate, advanced, or non-standard subject.
• A novel perspective or an unusual approach to teaching a subject.
ULNP especially encourages new, original, and idiosyncratic approaches to physics teaching
at the undergraduate level.
The purpose of ULNP is to provide intriguing, absorbing books that will continue to be the
reader’s preferred reference throughout their academic career.

Preface
This book was developed as a textbook for use in the course “Introduction to
Mechanics” in the Department of Physics at the University of Oslo starting 2007. In
this course we aimed at providing a seamless integration of analytical and numerical
methods when solving physics problems, thereby allowing us to solve more
advanced and applied problems in mechanics, and providing examples that are
perceived as more relevant for the students. We could address not only the very
special cases that have analytical solutions, but could instead focus on choosing
problems that would initiate discussions and provide the students with physical
insights.
Through the processes of introducing and developing advanced problems, it also
became clear that this approach brought the students closer to the way physics is
discovered and applied. In addition, it introduced the students to a more exploratory
way of understanding phenomena and of developing their physical concepts. Well-
developed examples that also include elements of numerical computations gave the
students a feeling of discovering physical processes while also understanding how
they are results of the underlying simple physical laws. In many cases, the advanced
examples and exercises spawned interesting and rewarding discussions about the
underlying physical processes, and also forced the students to understand the
various forms of representation used to illustrate physical processes, such as motion
diagrams and energy diagrams, and use these diagrams to reason about physical
processes.
As the course, examples, and exercises were developed it also became clear that
the introduction of numerical methods in an introductory course in physics also
helped build the notion that numerical methods are no different from analytical
methods—they are part of the theoretical toolbox that any physicist is supposed to
master. Our aim became to make it as natural for our students to solve their
problems by developing a small program and discussing the results, as it was to use
a calculator.
It has been particularly rewarding to observe the way that many of the examples
and exercises trigger discussions when students discover unexpected results, in the
form of unexpected resonances in a simple model for friction or in the case of
vii
Greenwood gaps in the distribution of asteroids in the solar system. The insight that
the simple laws of mechanics that they learned actually had observable conse-
quences and explanatory power was often an important insight as well as an
important reinforcer for the students. We also believe that this helps the student
build a more realistic image of how science actually is done.
In order to get most of the numerical parts of this text it is advantageous for the
students to have some prior knowledge of scientific programming, preferably with a
scripting type language such as Matlab or Python, but this is not absolutely nec-
essary. We encourage readers who are not familiar with scripting type programming
first to study Chap. 2. However, in our experience students who read the book,
study the examples, and do the exercises will already be developing programmers
by the end of the course.
This book grew out of a larger, collaborative effort at the University of Oslo.

in the physics part of the Computers in Science Education program. I also thank

Introduction
In this book we introduce the fundamental concepts in our understanding of nature
and learn to use them to deepen your understanding of nature. This is a bold and
sweeping goal—it is indeed the goal of physics. The tools and concepts from mechan-
ics have a central role in how a physicist thinks about nature. And an important part
of learning mechanics is to learn to think like a physicist. Unfortunately there are no
short-cuts to acquiring the experience of an expert. The only way to learn physics,
and mechanics, is through diligent application of the theory to example and exer-
cises. We will help you by providing hints on how to structure your approach, by
introducing well-tested problem solving techniques, and through worked examples,
but in the end it is only the amount of work you spend on exercises that will determine
your success. The examples also provide you with inspirations for what you can do
when you master the basic principles of mechanics, and we hope this will indeed
show you the power that lies in our knowledge of physics, and the exiting adventure
it is to discover how nature works and apply that knowledge to develop technologies
for the best of mankind.
1.1 Physics
Physics has several aspects: Physics as a science represents the quest to understand the
basic laws of nature. Physics provides the tools to understand the processes occurring
in nature on all time and length scales. Physics also provides the conceptual and
theoretical background for developing new technologies. The fashionable directions
in technological and scientific development change, but they all depend on a solid
foundation in physics. Physics as a scientific venture is an interplay between the
development of theory and experimental investigations.
How physics is used to understand nature is clearly expressed in the physics of
biological processes. If you are interested in how a protein folds—and how it folds
is important to understand its functions and interactions—we must understand the

2 1 Introduction
fundamental physics in the interactions between atoms, between the molecular parts
of the protein, and between the protein and the surrounding fluid. Physics provides
the tools to develop such an understanding.
Physics provides us with the tools to develop new, better technologies. Technolo-
gies that can help solve environmental- or energy-related problems. And physics
tempts us with possibilities to develop completely new technologies, based on so-
far unknown principles, that may lead to improvements larger than we could have
imagined.
There are still unsolved, fundamental problems that are within the reach of physics.
But in order to address these problems you must master the tools of the trade, you
must develop an ability to understand and address the physics of problems, you must
develop knowledge about the laws of physics, since we use this knowledge to guide
our intuition when we think of physics, and you must develop your knowledge of
mathematical tools so that you can solve real problems. This starts with learning
mechanics.
You will learn beautiful laws in physics. Much of the theory you learn will be
formulated in nice, mathematical equations, beautiful symmetries. It is elegant, con-
cise, and beautiful. And this is indeed something we want to show you. Nature could
have been in so many ways. But, look—it is so simple, and so beautiful.
But try not to be blinded by the beauty. The most beautiful and elegant mathemat-
ical formulations are found in the parts of physics that are finished. There is not really
anything left to do but to find new decimals in the physical constants. When a field
is under development it is often messy, unfinished, unready. It is uncharted territory
waiting for someone to make sense of it. There may be many exiting discoveries
waiting in the messiness. Such is often the nature of discovery.
1.2 Mechanics
Mechanics is the part of physics that addresses the motion of objects. However, in
order to predict motion, we need quantitative tools to describe motion. Our main tool
is calculus and associated analytical and numerical methods. The study of motion is
traditionally called kinematics, which is in many ways closer to mathematics than to
physics. When we approach a problem in physics we first use our physical insight to
simplify the problem. We strive to make the problem so simple that we can use simple
physical laws to formulate mathematical equations that describe the motion. The first
part of this process, finding a good physical model and translating the model into a
mathematical problem is what we typical refer to as the “physics of the problem”.
When we have formulated a mathematical description of the problem, we find the
motion and solve the problem using methods from our mathematical toolbox, which
contains both analytical and numerical methods. In practice, there is a significant
interplay between finding the right physical formulation and solving the mathematical
problem, because our insight in physics, and, in particular, in more general concepts
1.2 Mechanics 3
such as conservation laws, often allows us to find short-cuts that lead to an analytical
solution. Although, for many problems, and arguably for almost all applied problems,
there will never be a simple, analytical solution, and we must depend on our ability
to address problems using robust, numerical techniques.
In this book we will take you through this procedure many times. So many times
that it becomes deeply rooted in you. And as soon as you have grasped the simplicity
of the method, we hope you will keep it a secret—physics is supposed to be difficult,
and you are expected to uphold that tradition.
1.3 Integrating Numerical Methods
The most unusual part of this textbook is the integration of numerical and analytical
methods into the exposition of theory, examples, and exercises. What do we mean by
analytical and numerical methods? Analytical methods are the classical mathematical
methods you have learned to use in calculus, giving you an exact analytical solution
through derivation, integration, or the solution of differential equations. Numerical
methods are a similar set of tools that you may have learned to use to solve the
same types of problems on a computer: numerical derivation, numerical integration
and numerical solution of differential equations. We have developed this integrated
approach because we know that the use of computational methods are going to be
important for you—probably more important than the use of analytical techniques;
because it allows us to present you with more realistic and inspiring examples and
applications; and because it also provides you with a deeper understanding of the
underlying mathematics.
The use of computations to solve problems in mathematics and physics is not
new. For example, when the famous physicist Richard Feynman introduced planetary
motion in his classic lectures at CalTech in 1961, he used a simple numerical scheme
to calculate the motion of the planets. However, with the advent of the computer we
now have the possibility to do billions of computations per second with ease, and this
completely changes the game. We can now solve very complicated problems on any
computer—if we only know how. The use of computational methods is becoming
increasingly important in most areas in science and engineering, in academia and in
industry. Since the ambition of any education is to prepare you for a 40 year working
life, we know that you need to master the use of computational methods just as well,
if not even better, than you master classical analytical methods—since this is what
you will be using to solve problems.
This text is based on the principle that you learn best what you do every day.
That is why we have integrated the use of numerical methods into every part of the
text—it is part of how we explain the theory, it is part of the examples, and it is
part of the exercises you do. However, such an integration requires you to learn a
particular programming language. This text comes in two versions, one version based
on Python and one version based on Matlab. The text is identical, it is only the parts
4 1 Introduction
describing specifics of the programming languages that are different in the two cases.
It is an advantage to know some basic scientific programming before reading this
text, but it is not necessary—many students have become proficient at programming
simply by reading this text, solving the exercises, and discussing with students and
tutors.
1.4 Problems and Exercises
This book consists of several types of problems and exercises that have various
functions:
Discussion questions: A classical type of problems in physics are called “Fermi”
problems named after Enrico Fermi. They are mainly estimation problems of complex
questions with many unknowns. The main point of such a problem is not to identify
the correct answer—there may be none known—the point is the process of reasoning
to find an order of magnitude estimation of the answer. Such problems are well suited
for a group discussion. Similar questions have recently become very popular as part
of job interviews—since they test how the applicant think and apply her knowledge
and reasoning power to address an unknown problem.
Closed, structured problems: This is the classical physics problem. We call the
problem “closed” if all the necessary data is given in the problem, and “structured”
if the steps to go from the initial problem to the solution are given as subexercises.
These problems are popular because the teach problem solving by example and
practice by following a structured approach. The idea is that you will learn to do
this automatically for yourself if you have done it a sufficient number of times in the
exercises.
Open, unstructured problems: When you have practice in solving structured and
closed problems, you should be ready for open and unstructured problems. In “open”
problems, not all necessary details are given—you have to figure out or decide several
key facts yourself. This is the type of problems you will meet in your professional
life. Students may initially find these problems frustrating, in particular since they
have to introduce many approximations themselves and evaluate whether they are
appropriate. However, such problems may also be inspiring, since they allow for
more creativity and for more discussions.
Examples of open, closed, structured, and unstructured problems: An open,
unstructured problem could be: “A tank is filled with water from a faucet. How long
does it take to fill the tank?”. The corresponding closed, unstructured problem would
be: “A cylindrical tank of diameter 10 cm and height 20 cm is filled with water at a
rate of 0.1dm 3 /s. How long does it take to fill the tank?”. The corresponding closed,
structured problem would be: “A cylindrical tank of diameter 10 cm and height 20 cm
is filled with water at a rate of 0.1dm 3 /s. (a) What is the area of the base of the tank? (b)
What is the volume of the tank? (c) How long time does it take to fill this volume?”.
1.4 Problems and Exercises 5
Projects: We provide long, structured problems that require the application of both
analytical and numerical methods. In addition, we focus on discussion and evaluation
of the results, and evaluation of the approaches and approximation. The idea is that
you will learn the work-flow used in actual research through these project. Solving
the projects is considered a major objective of this book. Indeed, the text is meant to
give you the background to solve these problems.
1.5 How to Learn Physics
We actually know quite a lot about how to learn and how to teach physics. The
research area known as Physics Education Research (PER) is well developed, and
provide teaching institutions good insights into what methods work and how they
work. This knowledge is important for you, since it gives you a research based insight
into how you can optimize your time and learn physics as efficiently as possible.
Almost all pedagogical research (on how to learn physics) can be boiled down to
a single result: Students learn best when they are deeply involved in doing physics
(reading, discussing, solving problems) with material that is adapted to the student,
receiving immediate, individualized feedback.
Learning physics is an active, mental process where you have to construct the
knowledge in your own mind. Reflecting on how you learn is therefore important
for your own learning process. One aim of your education in physics is to be able
to think like an expert. Experts think about physics using a few general principles
that are organized in a hierarchy so that they cover all of physics. Novices tend
to think of physics as many, independent results—one for each situation, one for
each problem—which makes learning physics an hopeless endeavor in memorizing
formulas.
The most effective way to learn physics is to have a private, competent tutor
who can adapt the material, provide feedback, individualize explanations, give you
problems that are at the appropriate level of difficulty, monitor your thinking by
discussions, and help you correct your thinking to learn fruitful mental models. This
is actually the way physics is taught at the graduate level.
The second best way is to learn physics in a social setting where you immerse
yourself in physics discussions and thinking throughout the day. Discussions with
your co-students as well as your teachers will guide you, give you feedback on your
thinking, and provide you with direction on how to work. But you will have to provide
important parts of the individualization yourself. You have to choose how much of
the textbook you should read, you may have to select problems to solve and use
solution manuals in useful ways, and you are responsible for your own progress.
This is the environment we typically try to create at a college or university.
6 1 Introduction
1.5.1 Advice for How to Succeed
• Everybody can learn physics. Do not believe otherwise. Experiments with one-to-
one mentoring shows that large improvements can be gained by attending a proper
learning regimen. You can do it—but it will require effort. Take responsibility for
your own learning.
• You learn efficiently by trying to frame your understanding of a problem in words—
you learn by discussing physics with other students and your teachers. It turns out
that it is the one who does the explaining who learns the most. Asking another
student about something is therefore an important part of learning, but it is actually
the student you ask who benefits the most—even if it does not feel this way. You
should therefore seek environments where you participate actively in discussing
physics problems: Attend workshops and teaching groups, find a good group of
students to work with, use web-forums actively to discuss and formulate your
understanding. If you participate actively in making a good learning environment,
you will benefit from this yourself.
• You learn from getting feedback on your work. You should therefore grab all
chances of getting feedback constructively: Hand in written exercises, demand rel-
evant feedback on the exercises, and use this feedback to guide your own teaching
process: Read based on the feedback and choose problems based on the feedback.
Try again if you fail.
• Act as your own coach. Set your own targets and measure how well you are doing
in reaching them. Prepare for the teaching you participate in. Reading even just
10 min about a subject before attending class will greatly improve your learning
outcome. Think about how you learn: What parts of the teaching activities do you
find most useful for your learning? What environments help you learn better? How
do you learn physics?
• Multitasking does not work—it is a myth. Your mind cannot pay attention to more
than one thing at a time. Trying to do more things at once decreases your overall
productivity. You should therefore try to work uninterrupted when as you learn
new stuff.
• Learning new things “hurts”—you should be able to feel the mental strain as you
push yourself to the limits. This text and many others provide solution manuals.
Do not use them recklessly! You only fool yourself. Even just glancing at a sketch
of a problem can significantly reduce the learning outcome from this problem.
You will not have access to this on the exam, and you will definitely not have
access to solutions when you solve real world problems. However, you will have
access to other examples. Learn to use examples in a constructive manner—initially
as templates for how to think and solve a problem, eventually as an automated
problem-solving approach that you can apply to any problem.
• A textbook is a perfect adaptive learning tool, since you can choose for yourself
what parts to read, when to read it, and how to read it. You can also choose whether
you want to start by reading, start from the example, or start from the problems.
Use this flexibility wisely, and reflect on how you use it.
1.6 How to Use This Book 7
1.6 How to Use This Book
This textbook is meant to be used as a stand-alone textbook in physics or as a sup-
plementary text on numerical methods in introductory physics. The book is intended
to be read linearly: first you read the text, then your read the examples, and then you
solve the problems. However, I realize and even encourage you to choose your own
learning strategies. The most important part is what you do in the form of tutorials
and exercises, and not what you read. The text can therefore be seen as supporting
material for the projects: In order to be able to do the projects, you need to read the
text and study the examples. Still, the book has a certain organization, which is based
on the knowledge that you may take several paths through the text:
Background: This text requires a course in calculus. It does not require a course
in numerical methods and programming, but experience shows that programming
requires maturity to master — and an additional course in programming is therefore
useful to ensure that the methods learned here become integrated into the toolbox of
each student.
Numerical methods: The main exposition of the material, the theoretical explana-
tion, includes both numerical and analytical methods where they are apt. We do not
separate them, since they are equally important. However, in addition to the use of
numerical methods in the main text, we have added addition material on numerical
methods, which is meant to provide a more solid mathematical foundation for the
use of numerical methods.
Problem-solving strategies: We introduce a few, robust problem-solving strategies.
These are meant to be general templates that you should become so used to, that you
use them without thinking about it. Initially, we therefore suggest that you follow
these strategies as closely as possible, but as you get more experienced you may take
short cuts or automate larger parts of the solution strategies. However, if you are
baffled by a problem, you always have the problem-solving strategies to fall back
on.
Proofs: Most of the more advanced material and many of the longer derivations and
proofs are left out of the text flow. However, you can find relevant derivations and
associated mathematical theory at the end of the book or online.
Examples: Each concept can be explained by key worked examples. These are the
central examples that may serve as templates for how to address a particular class
of physical systems. They are often extended and provide the best background for
solving the projects.
Chapter 2
Getting Started with Programming
In this text we integrate the use programming techniques and tools in our study
of physics. You will therefore need to know a few programming basics in order to
profit from this approach. However, if you do not have a relevant background in
introductory scientific programming, do not despair. Experience shows that you can
learn to program through your first physics course—many students have done this
successfully and with good results. In order to prepare you for the main text, this
chapter provides an introduction to programming.
2.1 A Python Calculator
We are in this text using the editor Spyder to work with Python. (Alternatively you
can use iPython—type ipython in a terminal window to start). When you start
Spyder, you get a window where you can type commands to be executed. Click on
the Console window in the lower right corner and type:
>> 9*4
36
Notice the difference between the text you type, which is preceded by », and the
results generated by the program, which are typeset without indentation.
Python can be used as an advanced calculator by typing expressions on the com-
mand line:
>> 3*2**3+4
28
Standard operators are plus (+), minus (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and power
(**). Powers of ten are input using e:
>> 4.5e4
45000
>> 2.5e-10
2.5e-10
which also shows how Python displays numbers.

10 2 Getting Started with Programming
Python has most mathematical functions and constants built in, such as pi, cos,
sin, and exp: To use them we need to load the pylab module first:
>> from pylab import *
After this we are ready to use the mathematical functions:
>> 4*pi
12.566370614359172
Python uses radians for the trigonometric functions:
>> sin(pi/6)
0.49999999999999994
As you can see, Python does not always round off as you may expect, even though
the answer is close to the exact answer (sin(π/6) = 0.5). You can find a list of useful
syntax, functions and expressions in the summary.
Python becomes more useful when you have a formula you want to use. For
example, you may want to use the formula:
T F = 9
5 TC + 32 , (2.1)
to find the temperature, T F , in Fahrenheit, given the temperature TC in centigrade.
We may type this formula directly into Python
>> TF = 9/5*TC + 32
Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin >"...
NameError: name "TC" is not defined
Ooops. That did not work, because Python does not yet know the value of TC . We
give TC a value and retype the formula:
>> TC = 40.0
>> TF = 9.0/5.0*TC + 32.0
To see the answer, type
print TF
104.0
Note that we are typing .0 after each number. This is because Python differs between
integers (1, 2, 3, 4, . . .) and real numbers, (1.0, 2.3, 4.9, . . .). Typing .0 or only .
(a dot) after each number ensures that the numbers are real. Also notice that integer
division is not the same as real division. With integer division 9/5 = 1, while with
real numbers 9.0/5.0 = 1.8.
Instead of retyping the formula, you can use the up arrow to find your previously
typed commands and execute them again. We have now defined a variable, TC. You
can see the value given to TC by typing:
>> print TC
40
Notice that we assigned a value to the variable TF through a calculation. We have
not introduced a function for TF. What does this mean? It means that if you change
the value of TC, the value of TF will not change automatically unless you retype
2.1 A Python Calculator 11
the formula for TF. You can check this by assigning TC a new value, and then ask
Python for the value of TF:
>> TC = 50
>> print TF
104.0
This is an important aspect of a programming language such as Python a variable
does not change value unless you assign a new value to it!
2.2 Scripts and Functions
However, we do not want to type in the whole formula each time we want to calculate
a new value for T F . Instead we can make a script, a group of several statements, or
a function, similar to an internal function such as sin.
Scripts
We can group several statements into a script, which we can reuse. You do this by
opening a new file in the File menu in Spyder: File → New file.... This
opens a new window with an editor. Here you can now type (or copy) the commands
we already used:
TC = 40.0
TF = 9.0/5.0*TC + 32.0
print TF
Now, we need to save the script. In the editor window you do: ‘File‘→‘Save‘. You
must give the script a name and choose where to place it. This will generate a file
with an extension .py - we call such a file a py-file, because it shows that the file
contains a Python script/program. You run the program from the editor window by
typing the F5 key. A dialog box will show up. Select Execute in current
..., leave all other options as they are and click the Run button. As a result the
commands in the script are executed as if they were typed into the Python window,
and the resulting output is shown in the Python window:
104.0
You can now change the value of TC in the script and rerun the script to redo
the calculation for another temperature. Notice that we wrote the script so that the
temperature TC is assigned inside the script. This means that if you change the value
of TC on the command line, for example by typing:
>> TC = 45.0
and then run the script—the script will not use this new value of TC, but instead use
the value from inside the script.
12 2 Getting Started with Programming
Writing scripts to solve simple problems will be our standard operating procedure
throughout this text. This is an efficient way to develop a simple program, change
the parameters (such as changing TC), and rerun the program with new parameters.
While this is practical for developing short programs and solving simple problems,
it is not good programming practice. In general, we encourage the development of
good programming practices, but in this text we will prioritize making the code as
simple as possible.
Functions
From a programming perspective, it is better to introduce a function to calculate
the temperature. A user defined function acts just like a predefined mathematical
function such as sin or exp. We define a function by opening a new py-file: Push
File → New File .... We define a function by typing the following into the
editor:
def convertF(TC):
# Converts from centigrade to Fahrenheit
TF = 9.0/5.0*TC + 32.0
return TF
and save it with the name convertF.py.
What do these statements do? We define a function by the command def followed
by the name of the function, the input arguments. The line must end with a colon, :.
Here the only argument is the temperature in centigrades, TC. Inside the function we
must calculate the value of TF, because this is the value the function is supposed to
calculate. Finally, we specify that the function will return the value of the variable TF.
We call our new function by typing:
>> convertF(45.0)
113.0
Notice that Python requires each such used-defined function to either be in the same
file as the script using the function, of the function must be in a separate file, and that
the file must be in the search path for Python. This means that the file convertF.py
must be in the current directory or in the standard Python directory for this to work.
I suggest that you always save the functions you need in the same directory as you
save the scripts you are currently working on, and that you make new directories for
each problem.
A particular feature of functions is that the internal calculations and variables used
inside the function are lost as soon as the function is finished. For example, Python
may use several calculation steps if we call the sin function, but this is hidden from
us. Outside the function, we only see the result of the function. To illustrate this, we
could break our short function into several steps:
2.2 Scripts and Functions 13
def convertF2(TC):
# Converts from centigrade to Fahrenheit
ratio = 9.0/5.0
constant = 32.0
TF = factor*TC + constant
return TF
Here, we have introduced two internal variables, ratio and constant, that are
forgotten as soon as the function is finished. For example, if we type:
>> convertF2(45.0)
113
>> print ratio
Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin >", ...
NameError: name "ratio" is not defined
we see that Python does not know the value of ratio after the function has done
its work.
Functions are powerful and necessary tools of more advanced programming tech-
niques and will be gradually introduced throughout the text. But initially we try to
make the programs as simple as possible, and we will therefore use simple scripting
as our main tool.
2.3 Plotting Data-Sets
Python not only works as a numerical calculator, it also has advanced data visu-
alization capabilities. For example, as part of a laboratory exercise you may have
measured the volume and mass of a set of steel spheres. You number the measure-
ments using the index, i, and record masses m i and volumes Vi in Table 2.1, where
we have used that 1 litre = 1 l = 1 dm 3 .
Such a sequence of numbers are stored in an array (or a vector) in Python. We
define the sequence of masses and volumes in Python using
>> m = array([1.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,9.0,11.0])
>> V = array([0.13,0.26,0.50,0.77,1.15,1.36])
We can find an individual mass value by:
>> print m[0]
1.0
>> m[3]
6.0
Table 2.1 Measurement of masses m i as a function of volumes Vi
i 1 2 3 4 5 6
m i (kg) 1 2 4 6 9 11
Vi 0.13 l 0.26 l 0.50 l 0.77 l 1.15 l 1.36 l
14 2 Getting Started with Programming
There are now 6 values for the masses, numbered m[0] to m[5]. Notice that Python
starts enumeration at 0, so that 0 is the first element and 5 is the last element. We call
the array m a 6 × 1 array or a vector of length 6. The volumes are stored the same
way:
>> V[0]
0.1300
>> V[3]
0.7700
The enumeration of the two arrays is identical: element m[3] of the masses corre-
sponds to element V[3] of the volumes.
The relation between m and V is illustrated by plotting V as a function of m. This
is done by the plot command:
>> plot(m,V,’o’)
where the string ’o’ ensures that a small circle is plotted at each data-point. The
plot command makes a “scatter” plot—it contains a point for each of the data-points
m(i), V (i) in the two arrays. The two arrays must therefore be the same length—they
must have the same number of elements. We annotate the axes by:
>> xlabel(’m (kg)’)
>> ylabel(’V (l)’)
where the xlabel refers to the first array m in plot(m,V,’o’), and the ylabel
refers to the second array—the V array. The resulting plot is shown in Fig. 2.1.
Where did the units (kg and liters) go when we defined the mass m and the volume
V? We cannot use units when we introduce digital representations of the numbers.
We can only input numbers into Python and we have to keep track of the units. This
is why we specified the units along the axes in the xlabel and ylabel commands.

10 points (solid line) and for 1000 points (dotted line) (Right)

sin(x i ) sin(0.0) sin(0.1) sin(0.2) sin(0.3) sin(0.4) . . . sin(10.0)
2.4 Plotting a Function
Python cannot plot a function such as sin(x) directly. We must first generate two
sequences of numbers, one sequence for the x’es and one sequence for the corre-
sponding values of sin(x), and then plot the two sequences against each other. While
this may sound complicated, Python has functions that ensure that you can almost
directly write the mathematical expression into Python.
Loops
We want to make a sequence of x’es, such as 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . etc., and then for
each x i we want to calculate the corresponding value for sin(x i ) in Table 2.2, where
we generate x i from 0.0 to 10.0 in steps of 0.1.
How do we generate such an array in Python? First, we have to generate the array. 1
How many elements do we need? Going from 0.0 to 10.0 in steps of 0.1 we need:
n = 10.0 − 0.0
0.1 + 1 , (2.2)
steps, where we have added one in order to include the last step (otherwise we would
stop at 9.9 instead of at 10.0. We define an array of this length by:
>> n = int(ceil((10.0-0.0)/0.1)+1)
>> x = zeros((n,1),float)
Here, the function ceil() rounds up. Notice the use of int in order to ensure
that we return an integer and not a real. The function zeros((n,1),float)
generates and returns an array of size n by 1 which is filled with zeros. Now we need
to fill the array:
>> x[0] = 0.0
>> x[1] = 0.1
>> x[2] = 0.2
>> x[3] = 0.3
>> x[4] = 0.4
...
1 In Python it is not necessary to define the size of the array before it is filled. We could just fill it as
we go along, but this is not good coding practice, it will lead to very slow codes for large arrays,
and may cause surprising errors in your programs. We will therefore always predefine the size of
arrays.
16 2 Getting Started with Programming
Fortunately, there is a more efficient way of doing this—by using a for-loop. A
for-loop allows us to loop through a list of values 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1 for the variable
i, and then execute a set of commands at each step—exactly what we need. We can
replace the long list of x[0] = 0.0 etc. by the loop:
>> for i in range(n):
... x[i] = i*0.1
If you type this in, nothing will execute until you press Enter twice. Note also that
you need to indent the first line after the colon in the line with the for-statement. It
is only the set of commands that are indented that are part of the loop and that are run
several times. Indenting the line means that you add four spaces to the beginning of
the line (compared with for in the for-statement). Indentation is the way Python
recognizes a block of commands.
You can check the generated values of x by:
>> print x
[[ 0. ]
[ 0.1]
[ 0.2]
[ 0.3]
[ 0.4]
[ 0.5]
...
Notice how we specify the range of the loop, by specifying a sequence of numbers by
use of the range(n) function. Typing range(n) at the command prompt gives
you exactly the list of values for i. In Python it is important that n is an integer. If
we had not been careful to define n as an integer above, we would have need to do
it here by typing range(int(n)).
Now, let us put this into a small script. And let us also calculate the value for the
function sin(x):
from pylab import *
x0 = 0.0, x1 = 10.0, dx = 0.1
n = int(ceil((x1-x0)/dx) + 1)
x = zeros((n,1),float)
y = zeros((n,1),float)
for i in range(n):
x[i] = x0 + i*dx
y[i] = sin(x[i])
plot(x,y)
show()
Which both generates and plots the function sin(x). The variables x0, x1, and dx
provide the start, stop and step of the x-values used. You can now change them and
rerun the script to generate plots for other ranges or with other resolutions.
Notice that y[i] = sin(x[i]) must appear inside the loop—that is before
the end. Otherwise it would only be executed once, using the value i had at the end of
the loop. Putting commands outside a loop that should be inside a loop is a common
mistake—sometimes also done by experienced programmers.
2.4 Plotting a Function 17
The While-Loop
The for-loop is probably the loop-structure you will use the most, but there are
also other tools for making a loop, such as the while-loop. In the while-loop the
commands inside the loop are executed until the expression in the while command
is true. It does not automatically update a counter either. For example, we can change
the script to calculate sin(x) to use a while-loop instead by the following changes:
...
y = zeros((n,1),float)
i = 0
while i<=n:
x[i] = x0 + i*dx
y[i] = sin(x[i])
i = i + 1
...
Notice that we must assign i=0 before the loop and i=i+1 inside the loop, since
we now need to update the counter “manually” inside the loop. We also introduce
an “expression” i<=n which may be false (having the value 0) or true (having the
value 1). The loop continues until the expression becomes false. Notice that a common
source of error is to generate while loops that continue forever, for example because
you have forgotten to update the counter inside the loop. You will notice this because
your program never ends: Python will never stop or plot your results.
You may wonder what the point of the while-loop is, since it looks more cum-
bersome than the for-loop. We will use the while loop when we want to continue
a calculation for an unknown number of steps. For example, you may want to find
the motion of a falling ball up to the point where it hits the ground. However, you
may not know beforehand how many steps are needed before it hits the ground. If
the position of the ball is x(t) = 1000 − 4.9 t2 , we can calculate the position as a
function of time in steps of dt as long as x is positive using the following program:
from pylab import *
t0 = 0.0, t1 = 10.0, dt = 0.01
n = int(ceil((t1-t0)/dt) + 1)
t = zeros((n,1),float)
y = zeros((n,1),float)
t[0] = t0
y[0] = 100.0-4.9*t[0]**2
i = 0
while y[i]>0.0:
i = i + 1
t[i] = t0 + i*dt
y[i] = 100.0-4.9*t[i]**2
#stop1
plot(t[0:i],y[0:i])
xlabel(’t [s]’); ylabel(’y [m]’);
This script needs some explanation. First, we notice we update both now is t and
y and not only x as before. In addition, we see that we calculate the value of y[0]
before the loop starts, otherwise the loop would never start. This is also a common
mistake. Therefore, ensure that you understand why and what is done before the
while-loop starts in this script.
18 2 Getting Started with Programming
Vectorization
While loops are generally powerful and useful methods, there is a much simpler way
to generate sequences of numbers and plot functions in Python—and the method also
allows your code to follow the mathematical formulas more closely. This method is
called vectorization.
We can make a sequence of x’es in several ways using functions that are built into
Python instead of using a loop. For example, the function linspace generates a
sequence of equidistant numbers from 0.0 to 10.0:
>> x = linspace(0,10,10)
>> print x
[ 0. 1.11111111 2.22222222 3.33333333 4.44444444
5.55555556 6.66666667 7.77777778 8.88888889 10. ]
In this case we generated 10 numbers, but you are free to choose your own resolu-
tion. An alternative to specifying the number of points you want, as we do with
linspace, is to specify the step size. The expression r−[0.0:10.0:0.3]
returns an array starting at the value 0 and ending at 10.0 in steps of 0.32 :
>> x = arange(0.0, 10.0, 0.3)
array([ 0. , 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, 2.1, 2.4, 2.7, 3. ,
3.3, 3.6, 3.9, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.4, 5.7, 6. , 6.3,
6.6, 6.9, 7.2, 7.5, 7.8, 8.1, 8.4, 8.7, 9. , 9.3, 9.6,
9.9])
Ok—so that was simply an easier way of generating the array x. Why all the fuzz?
Because of a powerful feature of Python called vectorization: we can apply the
function sin(x) to the whole array x. Python will then apply the function to each of
the elements in x and return a new array with the same number of elements as x.
The three lines:
>> x = linspace(0,10,10)
>> y = sin(x)
>> plot(x,y), show()
are equivalent to the program:
from pylab import *
x0 = 0.0
x1 = 10.0
dx = 1.0
n = int(ceil((x1-x0)/dx) + 1)
x = zeros((n,1),float)
y = zeros((n,1),float)
for i in range(n):
x[i] = x0 + (i-1)*dx
y(i) = sin(x[i])
plot(x,y)
show()
2 Notice the small difference between the two methods: using linspace ensures that the first and
the last numbers are included in the list, but when you use arange(0.0, 10.0, 0.3) the last
number is 9.9 and not 10.0!.
2.4 Plotting a Function 19
Notice how simple the vectorized code is—it is almost identical to the mathematical
formula. We only have to define the range of x-values before we call the sin(x)
function. Beautiful and powerful.
The program above generates the solid line in Fig. 2.1. However, this plot has too
sharp corners, because we have too few data-points. Let us generate 1000 x-values
and plot sin(x) with this resolution in the same plot:
>> x = linspace(0,10,1000)
>> y = sin(x)
>> hold(’on’)
>> plot(x,y,’:’);
>> hold(’off’)
>> show()
The result is shown in Fig. 2.1 with a dotted line. Here, we have used a few more
tricks. We use the command hold(’on’) to ensure that Python does not generate
a new plot, which would remove the previous one, but instead plots the data in the
same plot as we have already used. Typing hold(’off’) stops this behavior—
otherwise all subsequent plots will be part of the same plot. We have also used the
string ’:’ to tell Python that we want a dotted line. You can find more plotting
methods in the summary at the end of the chapter.
The vectorization technique is very general, and usually allows you to translate a
mathematical formula to Python almost formula by formula. For example, we plot
the function
f (x) = x2e−ax sin(π x) , (2.3)
from x = 0 to x = 10 by typing (when a = 1):
>> x = linspace(0,10,1000)
>> a = 1.0
>> f = x**2*exp(-a*x)*sin(pi*x)
>> plot(x,f), show()
As soon as you have learned to transcribe mathematical expressions from the math-
ematical notation to Python you are ready to calculate and plot any function.
The technique of vectorization is a powerful and efficient technique. Python is
usually very fast at calculating vectorized commands. And we can write very ele-
gant programs using such techniques, ensuring that the Python code follows the
mathematical formulation closely, which makes the code easy to understand.
2.5 Random Numbers
Sometimes you need randomness to enter your physical simulation. For example,
you may want to model the motion of a tiny dust of grain in the air bouncing about
due to random hits by the air molecules, so called Brownian motion. We model this
by having the grain move a random distance during a given time interval. How do we
create random numbers on the computer? Unfortunately, we cannot generate really
20 2 Getting Started with Programming
random numbers, but most programs have decent pseudo-random number generators,
which generate a sequence of numbers that appear to be random. In Python we can
simulate the throw of a dice using
>> randint(6) + 1
3
where randint(n) generates a random integer between 0 and n − 1, where each
outcome has the same probability. If you type the command several times, you will
get a new answer each time. Python includes several functions that return random
numbers: It can generate random real numbers between 0 and 1 using the rand
function and normal-distributed numbers (with average 0 and standard derivation 1)
using the function randn.
2.6 Conditions
Now, if we return to discuss the motion of the grain of dust, we want to model its
motion according to a simple rule: I throw a dice. If I get between 1 and 3, the grain
moves a step forward, otherwise it moves a step backward. How can we handle such
conditions? We need a set of conditional statements, so that we can perform a given
set of commands when a particular condition is fulfilled. We need an if-statement:
if (expr):
<statement a1>
<statement a2>
..
else:
<statement b1>
<statement b2>
..
Here the expression (expr) is an expression such as randint(6)+1>3 which
may be true or false. If the expression is true, statements a1, a2, ... are executed,
otherwise the statements b1, b2, ... are executed.
Let us use this to find the motion of the grain. Every time we throw the dice, the
grain moves a distance dx = ±1. If the grain is at position x i at step i, the grain will
be at a position
x i+1 = x i + dx . (2.4)
at step i + 1. We can use this rule and an if-statement to write the script to find the
position at subsequent steps i = 0, 1, 2, . . .:
from pylab import *
n = 1000
x = zeros(n,float)
for i in range(n):
if (randint(6)+1<=3):
dx = -1
else:
dx = 1
x[i+1] = x[i] + dx
2.6 Conditions 21
Fig. 2.2 Plot of the position x(i) of a random walker (a bouncing grain of dust) as a function of
the number of steps i done (left), and when the walker is constrained to the zone −5 ≤ x ≤ +5
(right)
The resulting motion is shown in Fig. 2.2.
We will use if-statements throughout the text, often to enforce particular condi-
tions on the motion. For example, we could add a level of complexity to the motion
of the grain by requiring that the grain moved inside a narrow channel of width 10:
The grain cannot move outside a region spanning from −5 to +5:
#start1
from pylab import *
n = 1000
x = zeros(n,float)
for i in range(1,n):
if (randint(6)+1<=3):
dx = -1
else:
dx = +1
x[i] = x[i-1] + dx
if (x[i]> 5):
x[i] = 5
if (x[i]<-5):
x[i] = -5
#end1
plot(x),
xlabel(’i’), ylabel(’x(i)’)
show()
The resulting motion x i as a function of i is shown in Fig. 2.2.
For the interested reader, we include a particularly compact formulation of the
random walk, which you may have fun trying to understand.
>> x = cumsum(2*(randint(1,7,1000)<=3)-1)
>> plot(x), show()
You can research this expression by using the help-function in Python
>> help(cumsum)
22 2 Getting Started with Programming
2.7 Reading Real Data
When you work with physics you need to handle real data: NASA publishes data for
the motion of most stellar objects; your mobile phone has an accelerometer; and a
GPS that measures thousands of data-points in a few seconds. You do not want to
type in these numbers by hand. Therefore you need to be able to read files containing
numbers. For example, the motion of a sprinter running 100 m is given in the file
100m.d. 3 The file looks like this if you open it in a text editor (such as emacs):
0.0000000e+000 -2.1155775e-001
1.0000000e-002 -1.7485406e-001
2.0000000e-002 -1.3798607e-001
3.0000000e-002 -1.0095306e-001
4.0000000e-002 -6.3754256e-002
5.0000000e-002 -2.6388915e-002
...
A total of 972 lines of data. The first column gives the time, measured in seconds, and
the second column gives the position of the runner, measured in meters. Fortunately,
it is very simple to read such as file into Python. It is done by a single command:
>> run100m = loadtxt("run100m.d")
We split the data into two arrays t and x by:
>> t = run100m[:,0]
>> x = run100m[:,1]
and plot the data using
>> plot(t,x), show()
If you experience a problem where Python cannot find the file, getting an error
message like:
>> loadtxt("run100m.d")
... IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: "run100m.d"
It means that the file run100m.d is not in your current working directory.
2.7.1 Example: Plot of Function and Derivative
Problem: Plot the function
f (x) = e−x2

and its derivative by using the formula:

2.7 Reading Real Data 23
Fig. 2.3 Plot of f (x) as a function of x and its derivative d f /dx as a function of x calculated
using a numerical method
as an approximation for the derivative on the interval −5 ≤ x ≤ 5. You may use the
value h = 0.001 for h.
Solution: The function can be plotted directly by a vectorized approach:
>> from pylab import *
>> x = linspace(-5,5,1000)
>> f = exp(-x**2)
>> plot(x,f), show()
In order to use the numerical approximation for the derivative, we need to perform
the approximation for each of the x-values in the x-array. We access them by a
for-loop through the 1000 elements in the x-array:
>> h = 0.001
>> df = zeros(1000,float)
>> for i in range(1000):
... df[i] = (exp(-(x[i]+h)**2)-exp(-(x[i]-h)**2))/(2*h)
>> plot(x,df), show()
The resulting plot is shown in Fig. 2.3.
Even simple problems such as these are useful to implement as scripts saved in a
file, since this makes debugging—the process of finding and removing errors in the
script—simpler. If you make a small mistake, you have to retype all the commands
when you operate on the command line, but if you use a script, you simply make a
small change in the script, rerun, and that is it.
Summary
Using Python as a calculator:
• Direct calculations are done on the command line
>> 10.0*sin(pi/3)+4.0**3
• Defining and reusing variables
>> a = 2.0, b = 4.5, c = a**2 + b**2
24 2 Getting Started with Programming

• Vectorized operations are denoted by a leading . and are done element-wise.
Functions and scripts:
• A script is a sequence of executable commands stored in a separate .py-file
– All variables are available on from the command line afterwards
– The script is run by typing F5 in the editor
– Scripts allow rapid rerunning a program after changes in parameters
• A function can be part of a script of stored in a separate .py file. It has the syntax
def myfunction(a,b,c):
v = a*b*c
d = v**2
y = 2.0*d
return y
• The name of the function (myfunction) should be the name of the .py-file.
Variables defined inside the function, such as v and d are not available outside the
function
Plotting:
• You plot two arrays t and x versus each other by
plot(t,x,’-b’), xlabel(’t (s)’), ylabel(’x (m)’)
• Plotting markers and symbols are listed in Table 2.3.
• Plotting several data-sets in the same plot:
plot(t1,x1,’-b’,t2,x2,’-r’)

• Combining several plots into one figure:
subplot(2,1,1), plot(t1,x1,’-b’)
subplot(2,1,2), plot(t2,x2,’-r’)
• Saving a figure to a file: either by using the save button from the figure window,
or you can save a figure as a pdf from the command line by
savefig(’myfigure.pdf’)
where myfigure.pdf is the name of the generated file.
Loops:
• for-loops run a counter sequentially through a list of values:
for i in range(100):
x[i] = sin(i/100.0)
• while-loops run until a given expression is true
i = 0 while (i<100):
i = i + 1
x[i] = sin(i/100.0)
Expressions:
• if-statements are used to run a sequence of commands given a particular expres-
sion is true:
if (x>10.0):
y = 10.0
else:
y = -10.0
• Expressions return true (1) or false (0) and can be joined using logical operators
such as or and and as shown in Table 2.4

where μ is the average and σ is the standard deviation.

(c) Explore the logistic map for r = 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0.
2.9 Euler’s method. In mechanics, we often use Euler’s method to determine the
motion of an object given how the acceleration depends on the velocity and position
of an object. For example, we may know that the acceleration a(x, v) is given as
a(x, v) = −kx − cv. If we know the position x and the velocity v at a time t = 0:
x(0) = x0 = 0 and v(0) = v0 = 1, we can use Euler’s method to find the position
and velocity after a small timestep Δt:
v1 = v(t0 + Δt) = v(t0) + a(v(t0), x(t0))Δt (2.9)
x1 = x(t0 + Δt) = x(t0) + v(t0)Δt (2.10)
v2 = v(t1 + Δt) = v(t1) + a(v(t1), x(t1))Δt (2.11)
x2 = x(t1 + Δt) = x(t1) + v(t1)Δt (2.12)
and so on. We can therefore use this scheme to find the position x(t) and the velocity
v(t) as function of time at the discrete values ti = iΔt in time.

a(x, v) = −kx − Cv.

C = 5, and Δt = 0.01. Plot x(t), v(t), and a(t) as functions of time.
(c) What would you need to change to instead find x(t) and v(t) is the acceleration
was given as a(v, x) = k sin(x) − Cv?

Units and Measurement
In physics we study nature quantitatively—we describe nature with numbers. But
not with numbers alone. We need to relate numbers to the physical world using
measurement units. For example, you could measure the width of your desk using a
pencil as in Fig. 3.1, finding that the width is 6 times the length of your pencil and
2.73 times the length of your shoe. The number alone, 6 or 2.73, does not make any
sense in the physical world without the unit: a pencil or a shoe. Using a pencil or
a shoe may be practical for you, but not if you want to communicate your result to
someone else. Therefore we need standardized units.
3.1 Standardized Units
Here we use the standard units provided by SI1 —the Systeme International—that
provide a few precisely defined base units. For example, the standard unit for length in
the SI system is called 1 m. To ensure that this standard is the same everywhere there
is a standard meter bar, made of platinum-iridium, which is kept at the International
Bureau of Weights and Measures outside Paris. Accurate copies of this bar have been
sent to various national standards laboratories around the world.
All other units are derived from the base units in Table 3.1. For example, the unit
for force is Newton and the unit for energy is Joule. Both are defined as combinations
of the base units in the SI system:
1 Newton = 1 N = 1 kg m s−2 , (3.1)
1 Joule = 1 J = 1 N m = 1 kg m s−2 m = 1 kg m2 s−2 . (3.2)

This high level of precision may seem unnecessary, but units were no joke for
the NASA teams responsible for the safe landing of the Mars Climate Orbiter.2 The
Orbiter was launched in December 1998, and NASA lost contact with it on September
23rd, 1999. The Orbiter was last heard from as it approached Mars way too close to
the surface. It turned out that the two groups in NASA working on the approach of
the Orbiter used different measurement units. One group used English units (feet and
pounds) and the other group used metric units (meters and kilograms), and they had
not communicated this difference clearly. The result was devastating for the Orbiter
and now serves as a warning for all of us: Keep track of your units!
2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter.
3.1 Standardized Units 33
Numerical Notation
Measured quantities in the SI system may be very large or very small. For example,
the velocity of light in the SI system is:
c = 299792458 m/s , (3.3)
and the length of the E. coli bacteria is
l = 0.000001 m . (3.4)
A more practical way to represent these numbers is to use scientific notation, where
we use a base of 10. The velocity of light is then:
c = 2.9979248 × 10 8 m/s , (3.5)
and the length of the E. coli bacteria is
l = 1 × 10−6 m . (3.6)
We no longer need to count the number of digits to see the order of magnitude of the
number. This notation is also used by Python where we give a number by a decimal
number followed by e and the number x of tens, corresponding to the exponent x in
10x :
>>> l = 0.000001
>>> l
9.9999999999999995e-07
(Notice also the problem with numerical representation of numbers in this example).
Similarly, we use scientific notation when we input numbers in Python
>>> u = 1.25e6
>>> u
1250000.0
Prefixes
To make life simpler, there are prefixes for various standard factors so that we do not
have to write out the power of tens each time. Instead of writing
0.001 m = 1.0 × 10−3 m , (3.7)
we write
0.001 m = 1 millimeter = 1 mm . (3.8)
34 3 Units and Measurement
Similarly, we write
1 nm = 1 × 10−9 m , (3.9)
and the well-known kilometer:
1 km = 1 × 10 3 m = 1000 m . (3.10)
We need a large span of prefixes because our physical world spans over a large range
of scales.
3.2 Changing Units
There are many different units used to describe real world quantities: We may measure
speed in meters per second, kilometers per hour or feet per second. How do we
translate between them? Conversion is done by substituting equivalent quantities
represented by different units.
The method is best demonstrated by example. For example, the speedometer in
your car reports the speed to be 60 kilometers per hour (km/h). How can you convert
this to meters per second (m/s)? This is done by replacing km with meters and hours
with seconds by rewriting the units: 1 km = 1000 m and 1 h = 3600 s:
60 km
h = 60 1000 m
3600 s = 16.6 m
s . (3.11)
What about the reverse scheme? If the wind is blowing 20 meters per second (m/s),
what does this correspond to in kilometers per hour (km/h)? We use the same tech-
nique as above, although we need an intermediate step to write 1 m in terms of km
and 1 s in terms of hours:
1 km = 1000 m ⇒ 1
1000 km = 1 m ; , (3.12)
and similarly:
1 h = 3600 s ⇒ 1
3600 h = 1 s . (3.13)
We use these expressions to convert from m/s to km/h:
20 m
s = 20
1
1000 km
1
3600 h = 20 3600
1000
km
h = 72 km
h . (3.14)
3.3 Uncertainty and Significant Digits 35
3.3 Uncertainty and Significant Digits
Measured quantities are never exact, but have some uncertainty, which depends on
the measurement method. We specify the uncertainty of a measurement by giving
a range of values for the measured quantity. If a length is given as 25.0 ± 0.5 m, it
means that length most probably is between 25.0 − 0.5 m and 25.0 + 0.5 m. (For
quantities with a known distribution of values, we typically describe the range by
the standard deviation of the measured quantity).
In practice we use an even briefer way of specifying the uncertainty—by only
giving the significant digits when we write down the numerical value of a quantity.
For a distance of 25.0 ± 0.5 m it does not make sense to provide many more digits for
the length. Writing 25.0000 ± 0.5 m clearly overstates the precision, since we do not
really know whether the number is 24.5 m or 25.5 m. Instead we use the number of
digits to indicate the uncertainty. We only provide the number of digits we are certain
of—the significant digits. Instead of writing d = 25.0 ± 0.5 m we write d = 25 m.
This would imply the same: we do not really know whether it is 25.5 m or 24.6 m,
but we know that it is not 22 m. Standard practice is that the last digit provided may
be uncertain. If you write d = 25 m is means that the value could be d = 24 m or
d = 26 m, and if you write d = 25.0 m it means that the value could be d = 25.05 m,
but is probably not d = 25.15 m.
This implied uncertainty is why you should never report the full numerical values
you get from your calculator or your program. Your program returns a lot of digits—
as many digits as it stores—but these digits may not be significant. You therefore
need to ensure that you report only the number of significant digits. But how do you
know that? You know it because the uncertainty of the result of your calculations
will depend on the uncertainty of the numbers you put in. Your calculations cannot
improve the uncertainty! The results you report must therefore always reflect the
number of significant digits in the data you start with. And it is the number with the
largest uncertainty that determines the final uncertainty.
You will learn more formally about how to handle uncertainties in complex cal-
culations in your laboratory courses, but for now you can use the following rules of
thumb for handling the number of significant digits:
Multiplication: The number with the least number of significant digits determines
the number of significant digits of the result
Addition: It is the position of the decimal point in each of the numbers that determines
the uncertainty.
For addition, the position of the decimal point and not the number of significant
digits determines the uncertainty of the result:
3.4 mm + 10 mm = 13 mm , (3.15)
1000.00 m + 5 m = 1005 m , (3.16)
36 3 Units and Measurement
1 km + 10 m = 1 km + 0.010 km = 1 km , (3.17)
1.000 km + 10 m = 1.000 km + 0.010 km = 1.010 km , (3.18)
where you see how we lose small numbers due to uncertainty in the addends.
For multiplication, the number of significant digits in the result cannot be larger
than in any of the factors:
2.10101 N × 4.0 m = 8.4 Nm , (3.19)
2 kN × 4.400 m = 9 Nm , (3.20)
2 kN × 4.000 m × 2.600 s = 2 × 10 1 Nms . (3.21)
3.4 Numerical Representation
Several challenges arise when we use a computer to solve physics problems. First,
the computer only stores numbers and not the units. Therefore you need to keep track
of the units. Second, your programs always provide more digits than the number of
significant digits, so you have to keep track of the number of significant digits. Third,
the computer introduces new errors by itself—errors due to the digital representation
of numbers, and errors that are inherent in the algorithms we use to solve a problem.
Units on the Computer
There are no units in your program, so you need to keep track of the units yourself.
If you calculate the velocity of a car driving 2.0 km in 10.0 s, you find:
>>> x = 2.0
>>> t = 10.0
>>> v = x/t
>>> v
0.20000000000000001
It is your job to know that the units for the answer is m/s. Because you could have
done exactly the same calculation with x = 2.0 km and t = 10.0 s, and the answer
would instead be 0.2 km/s. Or you could have done the calculation x = 2.0 nm and
t = 10.0 ms, and the result would have been ν = 0.2 nm/ms.
How to ensure that you keep track of the units correctly? We advice you to write
the units into your code when you define numbers. In your script, you could write:
x = 2.0 # m
t = 10.0 # s
This does not solve the problem, but this is a habit that makes it easier for you to
spot the units.
3.4 Numerical Representation 37
In addition, we advice you to always use units on the axes in your plots. Indeed,
we argue that a plot in physics is not complete without units on the axes. Make this
a habit from the start!
Finally, as you become more proficient in numerical methods, you should also
learn how to rewrite your equations in non-dimensional form.
Too Many or Too Few Digital Digits
Your program tends to return a long sequence of numbers irrespective of the number
of digits you put in: It does not care about significant numbers as do we:
>>> x = 10.0;
>>> t = 3.0;
>>> x/t
3.3333333333333335
It is therefore always your job not to report the numbers you get out directly, but to
apply the rules of the number of significant digits before you report the calculated
value.
Digital Representation of Numbers
The numbers you use in your program can be of various types and are stored digitally
in various ways.
Numbers in computers are stored in units of 4 or 8 bytes, which is the size most
efficiently handled by the hardware. One byte corresponds to an 8-bit binary number.
One bit is a binary number, which means that it is either 0 or 1. With 8 bits we can
make 2 8 different numbers. For example, we could enumerate the numbers from 0
to 255 = 2 8 − 1. You may use binary as a data type in your programs, but you
will usually use either integers, called integers, or real numbers, called floating point
numbers.
Integers
Integers are usually either represented by 4 or 8 bytes of computer memory. This
means that there is a maximum number that can be represented. If you use a 4-
byte integer the integers can range from −2 31 = −2 147 483 648 to 2 31 − 1 =
2 147 483 647. However, in Python your programming language will sort out prob-
lems if you exceed this number by automatically switching to a data type such as a
8 byte integer. 3
3 In other programming languages, type switching is not standard, and you may “run out of integers”
with surprising results.
38 3 Units and Measurement
Notice that if you define two numbers as integers, for example, by introducing
them as integers when you assign values to the variables, the operations between
two such variables will be integer operations. For example, division will be integer
division, and will return an integer:
>>> a = 4
>>> b = 3
>>> a/b
1
Therefore, you should make it a habit of adding a .0 to all numbers when you assign
variables, unless you are sure you want to define an integer.
Floating-Point Numbers
While floating-point numbers are supposed to represent real numbers, they also have
a finite digital precision, corresponding to the number of possible values that can be
spanned by the 4 or 8 bytes used to represent the floating-point number.
Floating point numbers are represented by the (significant) digits, and an exponent,
using the method that we called scientific notation.
For a 4-byte floating-point number, the IEEE4 standard determines that 23 bits
are used for the digits and 9 bits are used for the exponents - including the signs
for both. 4-byte floating point numbers therefore have 6-9 (significant) digits, and
cover a range from −3.4 × 10 38 to −1.4 × 10−45 for negative numbers, and from
1.4 × 10−45 to 3.4 × 10 38 for positive numbers.
However, you will not encounter 4-byte numbers when programming in Python
since by default the floating-point numbers are 8-byte. In this case, numbers have
15-17 (significant) digits, and cover a range from −1.8 × 10 308 to −5 × 10−324 for
negative numbers, and from 5 × 10−324 to 1.8 × 10 308 for positive numbers. With 8-
byte floating-point numbers you will seldom encounter cases where you are limited
by the numerical precision. For all practical purposes you will be limited by the
number of significant digits in your measurements. While the number of significant
digits usually does not pose a practical problem, we still need to remember that the
floating-point numbers only have a given resolution. Not all numbers are possible to
represent, and rounding errors may pop up in unexpected places. For example:
>>> l = 0.0000001
>>> l
9.9999999999999995e-08
shows that even when you just enter a number, it may not be stored as exactly the
same number as you entered, however, the error, the uncertainty, is very small. This
has few practical consequences. But there is one practical consequence you should
be aware of: You should not test if a floating-point number is equal to a particular
value. For example, you are usually advised not to test if a variable is exactly equal
to zero, but rather test when it is very close to zero or when the variable changes sign.

3.4 Numerical Representation 39
For example, if you model a falling ball as a function of time, you may experience
that it never reaches precisely zero height, it may be slightly above 0 at one time and
then slightly below 0 at the next timestep—independently of how small you make
your time steps. Therefore, be careful when checking if a value is exactly equal to
zero!
Numerical Errors
We will address various numerical methods throughout this book. You should be
aware that the numerical methods themselves may also introduce errors, and that
these errors in some cases can be non-negligible. This may be because the methods
are unsuited for the problems we address, or it may, for example, be that you use too
large an integration step.
For most numerical methods from calculus, such as for numerical derivation
and integration, the error from the numerical calculation depends on the size of the
integration step, which usually corresponds to the time step. Typically, the error
decreases with the integration step, and you can improve your error by decreasing
your integration step. But only up to a certain limit, beyond which numerical rounding
errors dominate. Trying to get very precise results be choosing very small integration
steps can therefore sometimes lead to large errors. We will address these features in
detail when we discuss the various numerical methods.
You must always take extra care when applying a numerical method to analyze
your problem because:
• the method you apply may have an error that may affect the number of significant
digits in your answer
• the method you apply may be unstable, producing errors that are orders of mag-
nitude off the correct result
• you may have implemented the method incorrectly, producing a result that is
significantly wrong
We therefore always use our physical intuition and insight when we analyze our
results. You need to check whether the results are reasonable compared with your
intuition. And you also need to check whether the results violate basic physical
principles, such as the conservation laws of mass and momentum that you will
learn throughout this book. However, by ensuring that you always test your meth-
ods against standardized problems with know solutions before venturing into the
unknown, numerical methods provide a robust, versatile set of tools that allows us
to solve practically any problem in mechanics with the precision we want.
40 3 Units and Measurement
Summary
Standard units:
• In physics all quantities are measured in physical units, and we always need to
include the units when we present a quantity
• There is an international standard set of units, the SI units, which is based on a
few base units: meter, second, kilogram, mol, ampere, kelvin, and candela
• All other units are derived from the base units. For example, the unit for force,
Newton, is defined as 1 N = 1 kg m s−2 .
• We use scientific notation to present numbers, by giving the base number between
0 and 10, and an exponent of 10: 998.23 m = 9.9823 × 10 2 m ,
• There are standard prefixes for the most common orders of ten: so that 9.0 ×
10−9 s = 9.0ns. (See Table 3.1).
Unit conversion:
• Units are treated as ordinary mathematical symbols
• We can convert between units by replacing equivalent units, for example, we
can replace 1000 m by 1 km, or we can replace 1 h by 3600 s: 72 km/h =
72 1000 m/ (3600 s) = (72/3.6) m/s = 20 m/s
• We can similarly convert by replacing 1 m by (1/1000) km and 1 s by (1/3600) h:
20 m/s = 20 (1/1000) km/ ((1/3600) h) = 72 km/h
Uncertainty:
• Measuring a physical quantity results in uncertainty. We specify the uncertainty
by a range: x = 20.0 ± 0.5 m
• Number are given so that the last digit may be uncertain. We call this number of
digits the significant number of digits.
• If you multiply two numbers, the number of significant digits in the answer is
determined by the factor with the least number of significant digits 9.8×10000.0×
2 = 2 × 10 5
• If you add two numbers, the number of significant digits in the answer depends

Digital representation of numbers:
• Numerical quantities are without units, so you need to keep track of them
• Your answers and plots should include units
• Numbers are represented as integers or floating point number in the computer
• Floating point numbers have a limited resolution, which may lead to rounding
errors
• Numerical algorithms may introduce errors that are significant—error analysis is
important.

Motion in One Dimension
As a professional physicist you will be expected to be able to determine how things
move: What is the path of a proton through a curved particle accelerator? What is
the motion of a passenger in a car during a collision? How does a blood cell move
through the micro-capillaries in your body? Professionally and privately, you will be
expected to be able to solve any such problem your friends or your employer may
come up with. How can you pull it off?
Fortunately, there is a simple method to determine the motion of an object. Objects
move due to the forces acting on them. As soon as you have figured out what forces
are acting on them, and you have found a model that predicts the magnitude and
direction of the force during the motion, you can find the acceleration of the object.
From the acceleration you can determine the motion of the object given its starting
position and velocity. You will work through this procedure repeatedly over the next
chapters, gradually filling all the concepts with meaning, until the procedure becomes
a natural part of your way of thinking.
In this chapter we concentrate on developing our intuition of motion, on finding
methods to formulate mathematical equations that determine the motion, and on
developing analytical and numerical methods to solve the equations of motion.
You will learn to describe the motion of an object by its position as a function of
time. We introduce the velocity and the acceleration of an object, which are the first
and second time-derivatives of the position of the object. We also show how to find
expressions for the motion from the velocity or acceleration—finding the equations
of motion for the object.
4.1 Description of Motion
In a fantastic race in the 100 m finals of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Usain
Bolt set a new world record of 9.69 s. He even took the time to celebrate his victory
over the last 20 meters of the race. But did this affect his winning time? Could he
have run even faster?

44 4 Motion in One Dimension
In order to answer such a question, we need a quantitative description of the race.
We already know something: He ran 100 m in 9.69 s. But we want more detail—a
finer resolution of the motion. We want to know where he was at any intermediate
time from he started until he finished the race.
Motion Diagram
The first few seconds of the race are illustrated by the four pictures in Fig. 4.1. How
can we describe the motion of Usain Bolt in lane four? One method is to define
his position by the front of his chest. For each image, we draw a dot on the ground
directly below his chest, resulting in a sequence of dots along lane four. We can
now describe the race by measuring the distance, x, from the starting line to each
dot—giving us a sequence of positions, x i , at times ti , for i = 0, 1, 2, . . ..

position of the runner in lane 4 after 0, 1, 2, and 3 s. (Bottom) The position x(ti ) of the runner is
shown at 1 and 0.5 s intervals. Displacements Δx are drawn in blue

We plot a point at the position x i along the x-axis to illustrate the motion in a
motion diagram (Fig. 4.1, Table 4.1):
A motion diagram illustrates the motion by a sequence of positions x i at
subsequent times ti for i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., preferably at times ti = t0 + iΔt,
where Δt is the time interval.
Position and Time
From Fig. 4.1 we see that the runner is at x(0 s) = 0.0 m when t = 0 s and at
x(3 s) = 21.3 m when t = 3 s. Even though we have only measured the position
at discrete times ti , we expect the position of the runner to vary continuously with
time, as illustrated by the plot of x(t) in Fig. 4.2. This is indeed how we characterize
motion:
The motion of an object is described by the position, x(t), as a function of
time, t, measured in a given reference system.
Reference System and Origin
We have chosen to measure the position x along the lane. We call this direction the
x-axis. The position x is measured from the starting line, which we call the origin—
the point where x is zero. The choice of an origin and an axis is called a reference
system. The axis has a direction which tells us in what direction x is increasing—this
is indicated by the arrow on the axis. The axis is directed from the starting line to the
finishing line, so that the position of the runner increases during the race.
You are free to choose the axes and the origin of your reference system as you
like, but we usually try to choose so that measurements become simple, as we have
done here.

show the position at time intervals of 1 s, corresponding to the positions in the motion diagram.
The correspondence between the two representations of the motion is shown by inserting a rotated
motion diagram to the right of the plot. (Inset) A magnification of x(t). The average velocities at
t = 1 s for time intervals Δt = 1 s and Δt = 0.5 s are illustrated by the slopes of the red and
green lines respectively. The instantaneous velocity is illustrated by the slope of the dotted blue
line, which corresponds to the slope of the tangent to the curve at t = 1 s.
Velocity
The motion diagram in Fig. 4.1 visualizes the change in position over a time interval
Δt. The change in position from time t = 1 s to t = 2 s is:
x(2 s) − x(1 s) = 11.1 m − 3.4 m = 7.7 m (4.1)
We call this change the displacement, Δx(1 s):
The displacement Δx(t1) over the time interval from t = t1 to t = t1 + Δt is
defined as:
Δx(t1) = x(t1 + Δt) − x(t1) . (4.2)
4.1 Description of Motion 47
The displacement is read directly from the motion diagram as the length of the line
from x(1 s) to x(2 s). The displacement has a direction—it is the displacement from
x(ti ) to x(ti + Δt)—and it is therefore drawn as an arrow in Fig. 4.1.
The first few displacements in Fig. 4.1 are increasing. This means that he is running
faster. But how fast is he running? This cannot be described by displacement alone,
because the displacements become smaller when we decrease the time interval as
shown in Fig. 4.1. It is the displacement per time that describes how fast he is running:
The average velocity from t = t1 to t = t1 + Δt is:
¯v(t1) = x(t1 + Δt) − x(t1)
Δt = Δx(t1)
Δt . (4.3)
The average velocity has units meters per second, m/s.
The average velocities for the runner in Fig. 4.1 at t = 1 s and t = 2 s over the time
interval Δt = 1 s are:
¯v(1 s) = 7.7 m
1 s = 7.7 m/s , (4.4)
¯v(2 s) = 10.2 m
1 s = 10.2 m/s , (4.5)
However, if we calculate the average velocity from the bottom-most diagram in
Fig. 4.1, the time interval is Δt = 0.5 s, and the velocities are:
¯v(1 s) = 3.5 m
0.5 s = 7.0 m/s , (4.6)
¯v(2 s) = 4.9 m
1 s = 9.8 m/s , (4.7)
We see that the average velocities depend on the time interval Δt! We can understand
this from the inset in Fig. 4.2. First, we notice that we can read the average velocity
¯v(1 s) directly from the curve, x(t), as the slope of the curve from the point x(1 s) to
the point x(1 s + Δt). From the figure, we see that ¯v changes slightly as we change
the time interval from Δt = 1 s to Δt = 0.5 s because the function x(t) is curving.
However, we also see that when the time interval Δt becomes smaller and smaller,
the average velocity approaches a specific value given as the slope of the curve in
the point t = 1 s. We call the velocity in this limit the instantaneous velocity at the
time t, v(t):
48 4 Motion in One Dimension
The instantaneous velocity is defined as the time derivative of the position:
v(t) = lim
Δt→0
x(t + Δt) − x(t)
Δt = dx
dt . (4.8)
In the following, whenever we use the term velocity, we will mean the instantaneous
velocity.
Notation for Time Derivatives
Notice that the notation x′(t) for the derivative that you may be used to from calculus,
is not commonly used in physics. This is to avoid confusion with x′, which is often
used to represent a length in a coordinate system called the “marked” coordinate
system. The notation x′(t) can therefore be ambiguous: it may be interpreted as the
position x′ as a function of time, or as the time derivative of the position x. Instead,
we denote the time derivative of a quantity by the placing a dot over it. The velocity
is therefore often written as:
v(t) = dx
dt = ˙x . (4.9)
Visualizing the Velocity v(t)
The velocity v(t) represents the slope of the curve, x(t). In many cases it may be
useful to visualize the motion by looking at both the plot of x(t) and the plot of
v(t), as shown in Fig. 4.3. In this case, it is evident that the velocity is changing
throughout the motion. Initially, the velocity is increasing as the runner sprints out

from the starting line. In the middle of the race the velocity is approximately constant,
while at the end of the race, the runner is slowing down, and the velocity is falling.
Acceleration
The velocity may also vary throughout the motion. From Fig. 4.3 we see that the
runner starts at rest and increases his velocity with time. Just as we introduced the
velocity to characterize the rate of change of position, we introduce the acceleration
to characterize the rate of change of the velocity:
The average acceleration over a time interval Δt from t to t + Δt is:
¯a(t) = v(t + Δt) − v(t)
Δt . (4.10)
The instantaneous acceleration is the limit of the average acceleration when the time
interval approaches zero:
The instantaneous acceleration is defined as:
a(t) = lim
Δt→0
v(t + Δt) − v(t)
Δt = dv
dt = ˙v . (4.11)
When we use the term acceleration we mean the instantaneous acceleration.
The acceleration can be found as the slope of the v(t) curve. Figure 4.3 shows a plot
of a(t) together with both position x(t) and velocity v(t). Notice that the acceleration
curve is “noisy” and consists of clear steps. This is not a physical effect, but rather an
effect of how the data was gathered and interpolated. Real data often have noise from
various sources—so you should expect noisy curves when you look at real systems.
(You can learn more about how this data was measured in boltdatabox1 ).
Because the velocity is given as the time derivative of the position x(t), we can
also write the acceleration as the time derivative of the position x(t) by inserting
(4.9) into (4.11):
a(t) = dv
dt = d

dx
dt = d2 x

50 4 Motion in One Dimension
Fig. 4.4 Motion diagram for Usain Bolt. The top figure shows the velocities at time intervals
of 1 s. The displacements are interpreted as velocities. The top figure shows how the change in
velocity at t = 2 s is constructed from the velocity at t = 1s and the velocity at t = 2 s. The
resulting difference, Δv(2 s) is interpreted as the average acceleration. The bottom figure shows the
accelerations estimated from the motion diagram
Using the dot-notation, we can write this as:
a(t) = ˙v(t) = ¨x(t) , (4.13)
or in shorthand
a = ˙v = ¨x . (4.14)
Interpretation of Motion Diagrams
It is often difficult to obtain a good intuition for acceleration, in particular for two- and
three-dimensional motions, but sometimes also for one-dimensional motions. Expe-
rience shows that motion diagrams are useful tools for developing a good intuition
for accelerations—this is why we include them here.
As long as all the time intervals in a motion diagram are identical, the displace-
ments in the motion diagram may be interpreted as average velocities. In Fig. 4.4 the
displacements and therefore the average velocities, are initially increasing, until at
t = 4 s they are approximately constant. The change in average velocity from t = 1 s
to t = 2 s is:
Δ¯v(1 s) = ¯v(2 s) − ¯v(1 s) = 5 m/s (4.15)
We introduce the average acceleration2 as:
2 The attentive reader may realize that the average acceleration should really be defined in terms of
the change in instantaneous velocity: ¯a = (v(t + Δt) − v(t))/Δt and not in terms of the average
velocity as done here. However, this small difference in definitions becomes insignificant when the
time interval becomes sufficiently small.

The average acceleration can be constructed geometrically from the motion diagram
by subtracting two subsequent (average) velocities in the diagram, as illustrated in
Fig. 4.4.

This example demonstrates how we can find the velocity and acceleration from the
motion diagram of a falling tennis ball, both by hand calculation, using Python and
from a mathematical model of the motion.

Motion diagram: The motion of a falling tennis ball was captured with a digital
camera. The first few images were combined into one picture as shown in Fig. 4.5.
From the sequence of images, we measure the vertical position of the ball by compar-
ing the height of the center of the ball to the ruler seen in the images. The positions
are shown in Table 4.2.
We draw the motion diagram by marking the positions yi with dots along the
vertically oriented y-axis as illustrated in Fig. 4.5. We illustrate the velocities by
the displacements, which are drawn as arrows from point to point. The average
velocities can be calculated from the data: For each i in Table 4.2 we calculate the
average velocity from ti to ti+1 using:
¯vi = yi+1 − yi
Δt . (4.17)
The corresponding results are shown in the table. However, we cannot use this method
to find a value for i = 5 since we do not know y6 . We find that all the velocities
are negative. Since we have chosen the positive direction to be up (the arrow on the
y-axis points upward) this means that the ball is falling down—as expected.
The velocities are increasing in magnitude since the ball is accelerating downward.
We estimate the average accelerations by
¯ai = ¯vi − ¯vi−1
Δt , (4.18)
and the results are shown in Table 4.2. For the accelerations, we cannot find a value
for ¯ai for i = 0 or for i = 5, since the velocity are not defined at i = −1 or at i = 5.
If you look at Fig. 4.5 you can also see how to construct the accelerations directly
from the motion diagram.
The data shows that the acceleration is approximately constant a  −9.5 ±
0.5 m/s 2 throughout the fall. This experiment therefore tells us that a tennis ball
falls with a constant acceleration—which is close to what you may recognize as the
acceleration of gravity, g = 9.8 m/s 2 .
Mathematical model: A physicist friend of yours tells you that there is a mathemat-
ical model for the motion of a falling tennis ball when there is no air resistance
4.1 Description of Motion 53
y(t) = y0 − 1
2 gt2 , (4.19)
where g = 9.8 m/s 2 is a constant and y0 is the position of the tennis ball at t = 0 s.
Let us see how this model matches up with the observed data.
We calculate the position of the ball for various times. From the experimental
data, we see that y(0 s) = 1.6 m. We use Python as a calculator to find the positions
for all the times in Table 4.2 with a single line of code:
>> g = 9.8
>> t = array([0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
>> y = 1.6 - 0.5*g*t**2
>> print y
[ 1.6 1.551 1.404 1.159 0.816 0.375]
Notice that the command t**2 tells Python to apply the operation for each element
in the array t, generating an y-array of 6 elements. This vectorized notation allows
us write the code in a similar way to the mathematics. We can output the data in a
form that looks more like Table 4.2:
>> transpose([t,y])
array([[ 0. , 1.6 ],
[ 0.1 , 1.551],
[ 0.2 , 1.404],
[ 0.3 , 1.159],
[ 0.4 , 0.816],
[ 0.5 , 0.375]])
where the transpose() means transpose. Without it, the table would have been
oriented differently. Try it!
The resulting values for y(t) are similar to the experimental data, but in the exper-
iment the ball falls a bit slower than in the mathematical model: In the experiment
the ball is at y = 0.39 m at t = 0.5 s, whereas the mathematical model predicts
y = 0.375 m.
We can compare the results better by studying the velocities and accelerations.
In the mathematical model, we know y(t), and we can calculate the instantaneous
velocity and acceleration by applying the definitions directly. The velocity of the ball
is defined as:
v = dy
dt , (4.20)
and if we insert y(t) from (4.19) we get
v = d
dt
(
y0 − 1
2 gt2
)
= −gt . (4.21)
Similarly, the acceleration is defined as
a = dv
dt , (4.22)
54 4 Motion in One Dimension
where we insert v(t) from (4.21) and get
a = −g = −9.8m/s . (4.23)
The acceleration in the mathematical model is a constant. But we cannot really
compare with the experimental data, since they have too low precision. We need
better data!
High resolution data: To study the process in more detail, the motion of the falling
tennis ball was also recorded by a motion detector placed directly above the ball.
The detector provides the vertical position y of the ball, but at a much higher time
resolution that the images: The detectors measures y at a time interval of Δt =
0.001s. The data is stored in the file fallingtennisball02.d.3 The first few lines of the
file looks like:
0.0000000000000000e+00 1.6000000000000001e+00
1.0000000000000020e-03 1.5999950510001959e+00
2.0000000000000044e-03 1.5999803020031378e+00
3.0000000000000070e-03 1.5999557530158828e+00
... ...
where each line contains the time ti in seconds and the position yi in meters (given in
scientific notation, but with no unit). We read the data-set from file, using loadtxt
t,x = loadtxt(’fallingtennisball02.d’,usecols=[0,1],unpack=True);
This generates the arrays t, and x.
We see what is in the data-set by plotting the position as a function of time, y(t),
using:
plot(t,x)
xlabel(’t [s]’)
ylabel(’x [m]’)
What does the resulting plot in Fig. 4.6a show? From the plot, we see that the
ball falls down, bounces up from the surface to reach a lower height than the first
time, and so on. The first 0.5 s of the motion resembles what we found by analyzing
the images: the position decreases with time. And we see that ball is falling faster
with time—it accelerates. But it is difficult to see details of the motion directly from
this plot. Could you say if the acceleration is constant or not for the first 0.5 s from
this plot? To gain more insight, we need to analyze the velocity and acceleration of
the ball.
Numerical derivatives: Because we do not know y(t) for all values of t, but only
the measured values of y(ti ), we cannot find an exact, analytical expression for the
derivative of y(t) as we did when we had a mathematical model. However, we can
follow the procedure we used for the image data in (4.17): We can approximate the
instantaneous velocity by the average velocity from ti to ti + Δt:
dy
dt = v(ti )  ¯v(ti ) = y(ti + Δt) − y(ti )
Δt . (4.24)

The average velocity is an example of a numerical derivative of the position—a
numerical method to calculate the derivative. This method is easily implemented
numerically by directly converting the mathematical formula to code:
v[i] = (v[i+1]-v[i])/dt
We need to apply this rule to each element i from 0 to n − 2, where n is the number
of data points y(ti ). This is done using a for-loop:
n = len(x);
dt = t[1] - t[0];
v = zeros(n-1,float);
for i in range(n-1):
v[i] = (x[i+1] - x[i])/dt;
Here, we find n, the number of elements in the y-array, and the time difference dt,
which we calculate from the first two times since the time intervals are regular. We
also prepare an empty array v, which we will fill with velocities. But why do we
only make it n − 1 elements long? Because the formula v[i] = (y[i+1] –
y[i])/dt, cannot be applied to the last element in the array, since we would then
have no data for i + 1. (We saw the same in Table 4.2). For the same reason, we must
stop the loop at n − 2.
56 4 Motion in One Dimension
Similarly, we find the acceleration by using the numerical derivative of the
velocity:
a(ti )  ¯a(ti ) = v(ti ) − v(ti−1)
Δt . (4.25)
We apply this mathematical definition of the derivative directly to the data:
a = zeros(n-1,float);
for i in range(1,n-1):
a[i] = (v[i] - v[i-1])/dt;
For the acceleration, the formula v[i] = (v[i] – v[i-1])/dt cannot be
applied to the first element in the array, since we have no data for i = −1. The loop
therefore starts at i = 1 (Again, this is the same as in Table 4.2).
Plotting: We plot x(t), v(t), a(t) by:
subplot(3,1,1)
plot(t,x)
ylabel(’x [m]’)
subplot(3,1,2)
plot(t[0:n-1],v)
ylabel(’v [m/s]’)
subplot(3,1,3)
plot(t[1:n-1],a[1:n-1])
xlabel(’t [s]’)
ylabel(’a [m/sˆ2]’)
Here we have used the subplot command to generate a set of plots. (Consult
Python to find out how the plots are numbered using help(subplot).) Notice
that the velocity is only defined for i from 0 to n − 2. We therefore only include the
corresponding values of ti in the plot. Similarly, the acceleration is defined from 1
to n − 2, and we only plot the corresponding values of ti .
Plotting parts of the data: It is difficult to see the acceleration of the ball while it is
falling from Fig. 4.6c. How can we plot only the first 0.5 s of the motion? We find the
value for i where ti goes from begin smaller than 0.5 to larger than 0.5 using find:
imax = max(find(t<=0.5))
plot(t[1:imax],a[1:imax])
xlabel(’t [s]’)
ylabel(’a [m/sˆ2]’)
and plot a(t) for this range of t-values in Fig. 4.6d. (You could also have made this
plot by using the zoom button in the plotting window). The acceleration is clearly
not a constant in this case. It starts at −9.8 m/s 2 , but its magnitude becomes smaller
with time. (This is due to air resistance).
Comparison with mathematical model: How large are the differences between the
experimental data and the mathematical model for motion without air resistance? A
good way to compare, is to plot the model in the same plot as the data. The model
was:
y(t) = y0 − 1
2 gt2 and v(t) = −gt . (4.26)
4.1 Description of Motion 57
We implement these formulas directly in the program, and plot both data and model:
g = 9.8 # m/sˆ2
y0 = 1.6 # m
vt = -g*t
yt = y0 - 0.5*g*t**2
subplot(2,1,1)
plot(t[0:imax],y[0:imax],’-r’);
hold(’on’)
plot(t[0:imax],yt[0:imax],’--b’);
hold(’off’)
xlabel(’t [s]’)
ylabel(’y [m]’)
subplot(2,1,2)
plot(t([0:imax],v[0:imax],’-r’);
hold on
plot(t[0:imax],vt[0:imax],’--b’);
hold(’off’)
xlabel(’t [s]’)
ylabel(’v [m/s]’)
We use hold on to get both plots in the same figure (see Fig. 4.6e, f. Here we notice
that the differences in y(t) and v(t) are more difficult to spot. Using the acceleration
for comparisons was therefore a better approach to spot the differences. And an
approach with a sound, physical basis, since we will later learn that differences in
physics appear in differences in the accelerations.
Further work: We leave it to you to look more carefully at what happens during the
bounce. Can you zoom in on the relevant area?
Comment: Notice that the data in this example were based on numerical results and
not experimental data in order to get clear results. Experimental data will typically
contain significant noise, which we did not want to include here. The program used
to generate the data-set is makefallingtennisball.m.4
4.2 Calculation of Motion
Mechanics is about the motion of objects. Usually, we do not know the position as a
function of time. Instead, we want to determine the motion based on measurements
of the acceleration (or velocity); based on a mathematical expression for the acceler-
ation; or based on a differential equation for the position. We therefore need tools to
do the opposite of what we did above: We need tools to find the motion, x(t), from
the acceleration, a(t), of an object (Table 4.3).
Discrete Integration
As lead developer of “The Rocket”, a new roller-coaster ride at a major theme-
park, you have fitted an accelerometer into a test-cart. The accelerometer records the

acceleration of the cart at regular time intervals of 0.1 s. How can you use this data
to determine the velocity and position of the test cart?
The problem is how to find the sequence of positions, x(ti ), from the sequence
of accelerations, a(ti )? This is the reverse of what we have been doing so far, where
we have estimated first the velocities and then the accelerations from the positions
using numerical derivatives. Can we simply use the methods we have developed
for numerical derivatives “in reverse”? The average acceleration from t1 = 0.0 s to
t2 = 0.1 s is
¯a(ti ) = v(ti + Δt) − v(ti )
Δt . (4.27)
(So far this is an exact result—we have not done any approximations yet). We can
“reverse” (4.27) to find an equation for the velocity at the time t = ti + Δt:
v(ti + Δt) − v(ti ) = ¯a(ti ) Δt
v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + ¯a(ti ) Δt (4.28)
This method would allow us to step one step forward in time from the time t = ti to
the time t = ti + Δt, if only we knew the average acceleration of the time interval.
Unfortunately, the accelerometer does not give the average, but rather the instanta-
neous acceleration of the cart, a(ti ). Let us ignore this distinction and approximate
the average acceleration over the time interval by the instantaneous acceleration at
the beginning of the time interval:
¯a(ti )  a(ti ) , (4.29)
We are now in a position to use (4.28) to step forward in small steps of Δt, calculating
the changes in the velocities of the cart as we go. However, finding the velocities
only takes us part of the way—we also need to determine the positions, x(ti ), of the
cart, from the velocities, v(ti ), calculated using (4.28). This time, we “reverse” the
numerical derivative of the position:
x(ti + Δt) − x(ti ) = ¯v(ti ) Δt
x(ti + Δt) = x(ti ) + ¯v(ti ) Δt . (4.30)
Where we again assume that the average velocity is approximately the same as the
velocity we calculated in (4.28): ¯v(ti )  v(ti ). We are now ready to use (4.28) and

time interval (top figure) and the time-resolution is shown by the squares representing the measure-
ment points (bottom figure)
(4.30) to move forwards in steps of Δt. However, since these methods only give the
increments in the velocity and the position, we need to know the first velocity of the
cart, v(t0) = v0 and where the cart starts from, x(t0) = x0 . This is called the initial
conditions of the problem. 5
We are now ready to find the velocities and positions, starting at the time t = t0 =
0.0s:
1. At t = t0 = 0.0 s, the velocity and position of the cart is given v(t0) = v(0.0 s) =
0.0 m/s, x(t0) = x(0.0 s) = 0.0 m.
2. At t = t0 + Δt = 0.1 s, the velocity of the cart is:
v(0.1 s)  v(0.0 s) + a(0.0 s) Δt = 0.5 m/s , (4.31)
where the acceleration a(0.0 s) = 5.0 m/s2 is listed in the table Fig. 4.7. The
position of the cart is:
x(0.1 s)  x(0.0 s) + v(0.0 s) Δt = 0.0 m (4.32)
3. At t = t1 + Δt = 0.2 s, the velocity of the cart is:
v(0.2 s)  v(0.1 s) + a(0.1 s) Δt = 0.9 m/s; , (4.33)
where the acceleration a(0.1 s) = 7.0 m/s is listed in the table in Fig. 4.7. The
position of the cart is:
x(0.2 s)  x(0.1 s) + v(0.1 s) Δt = 0.05 m , (4.34)
5 Notice that we need two initial conditions, v(t0) = v0 and x(t0) = x0 to determine the position
from the acceleration: This is because we need to first calculate the velocities, and this requires an
initial condition of the velocities, and then calculate the position, and this also requires an initial
condition, this time on the position.
60 4 Motion in One Dimension
where the velocity v(0.1 s) = 0.5 m/s was found in the previous step of the
calculation.
This method is called Euler’s method for numerical integration, and it is suffi-
ciently flexible and robust to solve most problems presented in this book!
In Euler’s method we find the position, x(ti ), and velocity, v(ti ), of an object
as a function of time by a stepwise summation of the acceleration, a(ti ), and
the velocity, v(ti ):
v(t0) = v0
x(t0) = x0
. . .
v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + a(ti ) Δt
x(ti + Δt) = x(ti ) + v(ti ) Δt (4.35)
We apply this method to find the position and velocities for the motion of “The
Rocket”. The accelerations for the cart are stored in the file therocket.dat,6 where
each line contains a time (in seconds) and an acceleration (in m/s 2 ):

2.0000000e-001 2.6693138e+000
3.0000000e-001 4.2383806e+000
We read the data into Python find the time-step Δt from t2 − t1 , and apply Euler’s
algorithm from (4.35) for each i starting from the initial condition x(t0) = 0 m and
v(t0) = 0 m/s using a for-loop.
t,a = loadtxt(’rocket.dat’,usecols=[0,1],unpack=True);
dt = t[1] - t[0];
n = length(t);
x = zeros(n,float);

v[0] = 0.0; # Initial value
for i in range(1,n):
v[i] = v[i-1] + a[i-1]*dt;
x[i] = x[i-1] + v[i-1]*dt;
The resulting position and velocity plots are shown in Fig. 4.8.
The procedure presented here covers the most important topic in kinematics:
How to determine the motion of an object given the acceleration of the object. This is
important because you will later learn that the physics of a problem—the interactions
between the object and other objects—gives the acceleration of the object. Given the
acceleration it will be up to you to determine the motion—and you can do this
using the methods provided here: Either by using Euler’s method (or more advanced

techniques) to solve the problem numerically, or by finding a solution to the problem
based on the specialized techniques you have learned in calculus.
Formal Integration
A more formal formulation of the problem is to assume that we know the acceleration
a(t) of an object as a function of time. How do we find the position and velocity of
the object in this case?
Again, we realize that we have already solved the “reverse” problem—we know
that the acceleration is the time derivative of the velocity and that the velocity is the
time derivative of the position. We find the velocity by integrating the definition of
acceleration:
a(t) = dv
dt ⇒
∫ t
t0
a(t) dt =
∫ t
t0
dv
dt dt = v(t) − v(t0) , (4.36)
v(t) = v(t0) +
∫ t
t0
a(t) dt . (4.37)
When we know the velocity as a function of time, we can find the position by
integrating the velocity, starting from the definition of velocity:
v(t) = dx
dt ⇒
∫ t
t0
v(t) dt =
∫ t
t0
dx
dt dt = x(t) − x(t0) (4.38)
x(t) = x(t0) +
∫ t
t0
v(t) dt . (4.39)
62 4 Motion in One Dimension
If we insert v(t) from (4.37), we get:
x(t) = x(t0) +
∫ t

[v(t0) +

a(t) dt] dt
= x(t0) + v(t0)(t − t0) +
∫ t

[
∫ t

a(t) dt] dt . (4.40)
These equations constitute the integration method to find the position x(t)
and velocity v(t) given the acceleration a(t) of an object:
v(t) = v(t0) +
∫ t
t0
a(t) dt , (4.41)
x(t) = x(t0) +

v(t) dt = x(t0) + v(t0)(t − t0) +
∫ t

(4.42)
There is no need to memorize these equations. They follow from your knowledge
of calculus. You only need to remember the definitions of the velocity as the time
derivative of the position, and the acceleration as the time derivative of the velocity.
We can apply this method to find the motion for constant acceleration, a(t) = a0 ,
with initial conditions x(t0) = x0 and v(t0) = v0 :
v(t) = v(t0) +
∫ t
t0
a0 dt = v0 + a0 (t − t0) . (4.43)

Differential Equations
Usually, we do not have a set of measurements or a mathematical expression for the
acceleration. Instead, we find an expression for the acceleration based on a physical
model of the forces acting on the object, and from the forces we find the acceleration.
Given this expression for the acceleration, we determine the velocity and position of
the object. But this sounds exactly like what we did above? We integrate the acceler-
ation to find the velocity, and then integrate again to find the position. Unfortunately,
direct integration only works if the acceleration is only a function of time. In most
4.2 Calculation of Motion 63
cases, we do not have an expression of the acceleration as a function of time, but
instead we know how the acceleration varies with velocity and position. For example,
a tiny grain of sand sinking in water has an acceleration on the form:
d2 x
dt2 = a = −a0 − c · v , (4.45)
where the acceleration depends on the velocity of the grain! And a ball suspended
in a vertical spring has an acceleration:
d2 x
dt2 = a = −C · x , (4.46)
that depends on the position of the ball. Such problems cannot be solved by direct
integration, because the function x(t) and its derivatives occur on both sides of
the equation. Such equations are called differential equations. Finding analytical
solutions of differential equations require some skill and experience, but, fortunately,
we can solve them numerically in exactly the same way we did above.
Numerical Solution
In most mechanics problems, we want to find the position, x(t), which satisfies an
equation on the form:
d2 x
dt2 = a
(
t, x, dx
dt
)
, v(t0) = v0 , x(t0) = x0 , (4.47)
We find the solution by moving forwards in time in small increments Δt. We start
from the initial values x(t0) = x0 and v(t0) = v0 . We find the velocity and position
after a small time-step Δt using Euler’s method (4.28):
v(t0 + Δt)  v(t0) + a(t0, x(t0), v(t0)) Δt , (4.48)
x(t0 + Δt)  x(t0) + v(t0) Δt , (4.49)
where a(t0, x(t0), v(t0)) is the acceleration we get when we put the values at t = t0
into the expression we have for the acceleration in (4.47). We can now continue to
step forward in time, finding subsequent values x(ti ) and v(ti ) in steps of Δt. This
method is called Euler’s method. It is definitely not the best numerical method of
integration—actually we strongly advice against using Euler’s method. It’s strength
is rather in the simple, intuitive implementation. Surprisingly, changing the step in
(4.49) to the following:
x(t0 + Δt)  x(t0) + v(t0 + Δt) Δt , (4.50)
64 4 Motion in One Dimension
gives significantly better solutions for many problems. This improved method is
called Euler-Cromer’s method, and you can use this method safely for most problems
you encounter.

x(ti + Δt)  x(ti ) + v(ti + Δt) Δt (4.52)
4.2.1 Example: Modeling the Motion of a Falling Tennis Ball
This example demonstrates how we can calculate the motion of a falling tennis ball
given an expression for the acceleration.
Background: In Sect. 4.1.1 we studied the motion of a falling tennis ball based on
measurements of its motion. However, in physics we do not only want to observe
motion, we want to predict it. We do this by first analyzing the problem to find the
forces acting on the object, and from the forces we find a mathematical model of
the acceleration of the object. (You will learn to do this in the next chapter. For now
we will assume that the acceleration is given). From the acceleration, we find the
position and velocity by analytical or numerical integration. We call this recipe the
structured problem-solving approach.
System sketch: Your first step should always be to make a sketch the process. In
physics, our sketches are vessels for our thoughts. A good, functional sketch is
therefore an important part of solving a problem. While the left part of Fig. 4.9 has
a nice artistic appeal and also illustrates the motion in detail, we do not encourage
such detailed sketches. Instead, you should make a sketch that only focuses on the
most important features of the process, as in the rightmost figure. Here we illustrate
the object (the tennis ball), its surroundings (most importantly the floor), and the
coordinate system with a clearly marked axis. We have also illustrated the initial
position and velocity of the ball, and its position and velocity at a time t. Drawing
a simplified illustration helps you discern the important from the unimportant, and
it helps you convert a physical situation into a mathematical problem: The figure
shows the axis and the position of the ball, y(t), and nothing else.

Simplified model: From an analysis of the physics of the system, we have found
that the acceleration of the ball is a constant:
a = −g = −9.8 m/s 2 . (4.53)
(You will learn where this model comes from later. Now we only want to address the
consequences of such a model). In addition, we know that the ball starts from rest at
the position y0 = 2.0 m at the time t0 = 0 s:
y(0 s) = 2.0 m , v(0 s) = 0 m/s . (4.54)
We have now formulated a mathematical description of the problem we want to solve:
a = dv
dt = d2 y
dt2 = −g , v(0) = v0 , y(0) = y0 . (4.55)
Solving this equation means to find the velocity v(t) and the position y(t) of the ball
for any time t. We call this the modeling step, finding the mathematical problem to
solve, and the next step is to solve this problem—to find v(t) and y(t).
66 4 Motion in One Dimension
Solving the simplified model: Since the acceleration is given and a constant, we
can find the velocity by direct integration of the acceleration:

, (4.58)
which gives
v(t) = −gt . (4.59)
Similarly, we find the position by integrating the velocity:

2 gt2 , (4.62)
which gives
y(t) = y(0) − 1
2 gt2 . (4.63)
Analysis of the simplified model: This is the complete solution to the problem. We
know the position and velocity as a function of time. When you have this solution,
you are prepared to answer any question about the motion. For example, you can
find out when the ball hits the ground and you can find the velocity of the ball when
it hits the ground. How would you do that? You need to translate the question into
a mathematical problem. We do this by stating the condition “when the ball hits the
ground” in mathematical terms: The ball hits the ground when its position is that of
the ground, that is, when y(t) = 0 m. (Notice, we have ignored the extent of the ball
here). We can use our solution in (4.63) to find the corresponding time:
y(t) = y(0) − 1
2 gt2 = 0 m ⇒ t =
√
2 y(0)
g . (4.64)
A more realistic model: Unfortunately, data for the motion of the tennis ball, shown
in Fig. 4.6b, show that the ball does not have a constant acceleration. This is due to
4.2 Calculation of Motion 67
air resistance—an effect not included in the simplified model. Fortunately, we have
good models for air resistance. For a falling ball in air, a more realistic model that
includes the effect of air resistance is:
a = −g − Dv|v| , (4.65)
where v = v(t) is the velocity of the ball, g = 9.8 m/s 2 is the same constant as above,
and the constant D depends on details of the ball. For a tennis ball D = 0.0245 m−1
is a reasonable value. (You will learn about the background for this model and how
to determine values for D later). We can now formulate a mathematical problem:
a = dv
dt = −g − Dv|v| , (4.66)
with initial conditions v(0 s) = 0 m/s and y(0 s) = 2.0 m.
Solution of the realistic model: Our task is to solve this problem, which means to
find v(t) and y(t) for the ball. This can be done either numerically or analytically.
The numerical solution is straightforward, using the approach we have derived, but
the analytical solution requires some knowledge of differential equations.
Numerical solution: We apply Euler-Cromer’s method to find the positions and
velocities by stepwise integration starting from the initial conditions. The integration
step in Euler-Cromer’s method is:
v(ti + Δt) = v(t0) + a(ti , vi , yi ) Δt (4.67)
y(ti + Δt) = y(t0) + v(ti + Δt) Δt , (4.68)
where we insert the acceleration from (4.65):
a(ti , vi , yi ) = −g − Dv(ti )|v(ti )| , (4.69)
This is implemented as follows: We define the physical constants and values given
in the problem: g, D, y(0) and v(0):
D = 0.0245 # mˆ-1
g = 9.8 # m/sˆ2
y0 = 2.0
v0 = 0.0
We need to determine for how long we want to calculate the motion: What will be
our maximum value of t? There are typically two strategies: We can make an initial
guess for the duration of the simulation, or we can determine when the simulation
should stop during the simulation. First, we make a guess for the duration of the
simulation. Based on the existing data from Fig. 4.6 we guess that t = 0.5 s is a
reasonable simulation time:
time = 0.5
68 4 Motion in One Dimension
Next, we need to decide the time-step Δt. This needs to be small enough to ensure
a good precision of the result, but not too small or the simulation takes too long. We
try a value of Δt = 0.00001 s:
dt = 0.00001
Based on this, we calculate how many simulation steps we need, n = t/Δt, and
generate arrays for the positions, velocities, accelerations and time for the simulation.
All values are initially set to zero:
# Variables
n = ceil(time/dt)
y = zeros(n,float)
v = zeros(n,float)
a = zeros(n,float)
t = zeros(n,float)
Then we set the initial conditions:
# Initialize
y[0] = y0
v[0] = v0
Before, finally, the Euler-Cromer steps are implemented in an integration loop. The
whole program is given in the following:
from pylab import *
D = 0.0245 # mˆ-1
g = 9.8 # m/sˆ2
y0 = 2.0
v0 = 0.0
time = 0.5
dt = 0.00001
# Variables
n = ceil(time/dt)
y = zeros(n,float)
v = zeros(n,float)
a = zeros(n,float)
t = zeros(n,float)
# Initialize
y[0] = y0
v[0] = v0
# Integration loop
for i in range(n-1):
a[i] = -g -D*v[i]*abs(v[i])
v[i+1] = v[i] + a[i]*dt
y[i+1] = y[i] + v[i+1]*dt
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
The resulting plots of x(t), v(t), and a(t) are shown in Fig. 4.10.
Analysis of realistic model results: We can now use this result to answer questions
like how long does it take until the ball hits the ground? Again, we answer the
question by translating it into a mathematical question: The ball hits the ground
when y(t) = 0 m. However, in this case, we must find the solution numerically.
The simplest approach to this would be to find when y becomes zero during the
simulation. It is tempting to do this by checking when y(t) = 0 m:
if (y[i]==0.0)
print t[i]

But this will not work, because y(ti ) will usually not be zero for any i. Typically,
the program will step right past y = 0 going from a small positive value at some ti
to a small negative value at ti+1 . We should instead find the first time y(t) passes 0,
that is, we should find the first ti+1 when y(ti+1) < 0. Then we know that y(t) = 0
somewhere in the interval ti < t < ti+1 . We can then estimate a precise value for
t using interpolation, or we can simply use the value ti+1 , if we find that this gives
us sufficient precision. This is implemented in the following modification to the
program, where we have also stopped the calculation when the ball hits the ground:
for i in range(n-1):
a[i] = -g -D*v[i]*abs(v[i])
v[i+1] = v[i] + a[i]*dt
y[i+1] = y[i] + v[i+1]*dt
if (y[i+1]<0):
break
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
print v[i+1]
plot(t[0:i-1],a[0:i-1])
xlabel(’t [s]’);
ylabel(’a [m/sˆ2]’);
where we have used break to stop the loop when the condition is met. Notice that
we should now only plot the values up to i, because we have not calculated any more
values. The values from i + 2 to n were set to zero initially for y, v, and a and will
make your plot confusing if you include them. (Try it and see).
Test your understanding: What would happen if we considered that the ball had an initial velocity
v0 = −2v T when it started? Sketch the resulting position, velocity and acceleration as a function
of time.
Analytical solution: The differential equation in (4.66) is one of a few equations we
can solve analytically as long as the velocity does not change sign. When the ball is
falling down, the velocity is negative, and we can replace |v| by −v:
70 4 Motion in One Dimension
dv
dt = −g − Dv (−v) = −g + D v2 . (4.70)
This equation can be solved using separation of variables.
We separate the variables, so that all v’s are on the left side and all t’s are on the
right: dv
g − Dv2 = −1 dt . (4.71)
The differential equation can now be solved by integrating each side from v0 = 0 m/s
to v and from t0 = 0 s to t:
∫ v
v0
dv
g − Dv2 =
∫ t
t0
−1 dt = −t , (4.72)
The left-side integral can be solved using your knowledge from calculus (or by using
the symbolic solver in Python) giving:
∫ v
0
dv
g − Dv2 = 1
g v T tanh−1
( v
v T
)
, (4.73)
where we have introduced the quantity v T = √g/D to simplify the notation. We
notice that v T has dimensions m/s, and we may therefore call it a velocity. We insert
(4.73) back into (4.72), getting
v T tanh−1 (v/v T ) = −gt ⇒ v = v T tanh (−gt/v T ) . (4.74)
We have now found the velocity on the form v = v(t), and we can simply integrate
the velocity from t0 to t to find y(t):
y(t) − y(t0) =
∫ t
t0
v(t) dt =
∫ t
0
v T tanh
(
− gt
v T
)
dt . (4.75)
This integral can solved by the symbolic integrator in Python giving:
y(t) = y(0) − v2
T /g log cosh gt
v T
. (4.76)
Figure 4.10 shows that the analytical solutions (given by circles) are identical to the
numerical solutions (lines).
Symbolic solution: The differential equation in (4.66) can also be solved directly
using the symbolic solver in Python. We can solve the differential equation for the
velocity, v(t): dv
dt = −g + D v2 , v(0) = 0 . (4.77)
4.2 Calculation of Motion 71
First, we define the variables g and D as symbolic variables, and the function v(t)
as a symbolic functions:
>> from sympy import *
>> v = Function(’v’)
>> t = Symbol(’t’,real=True,positive=True)
>> g = Symbol(’g’,real=True,positive=True)
>> D = Symbol(’D’,real=True,positive=True)
Python can then solve the equation with the initial condition by
>> dsolve(Derivative(v(t),t)+g-D*v(t)**2,v(t))
-sqrt(1/(D*g))*log(-g*sqrt(1/(D*g)) + v(t))/2 +
... sqrt(1/(D*g))*log(g*sqrt(1/(D*g)) + v(t))/2 == C1 - t
Then, we need to determine the value of the unknown constant from the initial
condition, v(0) = 0, which sets C1 to zero. After some reorganization, we find
-(sqrt(g)*tanh(sqrt(D*g)*t))/sqrt(D)
which is the same answer as we found by our analytical solution. We can then find
the position by symbolic integration of this equation:
>> integrate(-(sqrt(g)*tanh(sqrt(D*g)*t))/sqrt(D),t)
-sqrt(g)*(-t - log(tanh(sqrt(D)*sqrt(g)*t) - 1)/...
(sqrt(D)*sqrt(g)))/sqrt(D)
Analysis of analytical solution: We can now use the analytical solution to solve
problems of interest, such as finding out when the ball hits the floor, which occurs
at y(t) = 0 m, that is, when
y(0) = v2
T /g log cosh gt
v T

that is:

Summary
Motion: The motion of an object is described by:
• the position, x(t), as a function of time, measured in a specified coordinate system
• the velocity v(t) = dx/dt
• the acceleration a(t) = dv/dt = d2 x/dt2
Structured problem-solving approach:
• The structured problem-solving approach is illustrated in Fig. 4.11.

Solution methods: In the “Solver” we solve the equation:
d2 x
dt2 = a(t, x, dx
dt ) .
with the initial conditions x(t0) = x0 and v(t0) = v0 .
• Numerically, we solve the equation using an iterative approach starting from the
initial conditions. For example, we can use Euler-Cromer’s method:
v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + Δt · a(x(ti ), v(ti ), ti ) ,
x(ti + Δt) = x(ti ) + Δt · v(ti + Δt) .
• Analytically, when the acceleration, a = a(t), is only a function of time, t, we can
solve the equations by direct integration:
v(t) = v(t0) +
∫ t
t0
a(t)dt , x(t) = x(t0) +
∫ t
t0
v(t)dt ,
A typical example is motion with constant acceleration.
• When the acceleration has a general form, a = a(t, x, v), we need to solve the
differential equation. In this case, there are no general approaches that always
work. Instead, you must rely on your experience and your knowledge of calculus.

4.28 A swimming bacterium. When the heliobacter bacteria swims, it is driven
by the rotational motion of its tiny tail. It swims almost at a constant velocity, with
small fluctuations due to variations in the rotational motion. As a simple model for
the motion, we assume that the bacteria starts with the velocity v = 10 μ m/s at the
time t = 0 s, and is then subject to the acceleration, a(t) = a0 sin(2πt/T ), where
a0 = 1 μ m/s 2 , and T = 1 ms.

4.29 Resistance. (This problem requires some knowledge of statistics). An electron
is moving with a constant acceleration, a0 , through a conductor. However, there are
many small irregularities in the conductor—called scattering centers. If the electron
hits a scattering center it stops, that is, its velocity immediately becomes zero. The
scatting centers have a constant density. The probability for the electron to hit a
scattering center when it moves a distance Δx is P = Δx/b, where b is a length
describing the typical length between two scattering centers. Assume that the electron
starts from rest. (For simplicity, we measure lengths in nm and time in ns, and you
can assume that b = 1 nm and that a0 = 1 nm/ns 2 ). First, we address the case without
scattering.
(a) Write a program to find the motion of the electron using Euler-Cromer’s method
to find the velocity and position from the acceleration. Plot the position, x(t), and
velocity, v(t), of the electron as functions of time and compare with the exact result.
(b) During the time interval Δt, the electron moves from x(t) to x(t + Δt). The
probability for the electron to stop during this interval is P = (x(t + Δt) − x(t))/b.

4.30 Ball on vibrating surface. A ball is falling vertically through air over a vibrat-
ing surface. The position of the surface is x w(t) = A cos ωt, where A = 1 cm and
ω is called the angular frequency of the vibrations. The ball starts from a position
x = 10 cm at t = 0 s. The acceleration of the ball is given as:
a(x, v, t) =
{ −g x > x w
−g − C(x − x w) x ≤ x w . (4.81)
where g = 9.81 m/s 2 and C = 10000.0 s−2 .

initial conditions for the ball.
(b) Write down the algorithm to find the position and velocity at ti+1 = ti + Δt
given the position and velocity at ti . Use Euler-Cromer’s scheme.
(c) Write a program to find the position and velocity of the ball as a function of time.
(d) Check your program by comparing the initial motion of the ball with the exact
solution when the acceleration is constant. Plot the results.
(e) Check your program by first studing the behavior when the vibrating surface is
stationary, that is, when A = 0 m and x w = 0 m. Plot the resulting behavior. Ensure
that your timestep is small enough, Δt = 10−5 s. What happens if you increase the
timestep to Δt = 0.02 s?
(f) Finally, use your program to model the motion of the ball when the surface is
vibrating. Use A = 0.01 m, ω = 10 s−1 , and simulate 5 s of motion. Plot the results.
What is happening?
(g) What happens if you increase the vibrational frequency to ω = 30 s−1 ?. Plot the
results. Can you explain the difference from ω = 10 s−1 ?

Projects
4.31 Sliding on snow. In this project we address the motion of an object sliding on
a slippery surface—such as a ski sliding in a snowy track. You will learn how to find
the equation of motion for sliding systems both analytically and numerically, and to
interpret the results.
We start by studying a simplified situation called frictional motion: A block is
sliding on a surface. moving with a velocity v in the positive x-direction. The forces
from the interactions with the surface results in an acceleration:
a =
⎧
⎨
⎩
−μ(|v|)g v > 0
0 v = 0
μ(|v|)g v < 0
, (4.82)
where g = 9.8 m/s 2 is the acceleration of gravity. Let us first assume that μ(v) =
μ = 0.1 for the surface. That is, we assume that the coefficient of friction does not
depend on the velocity of the block. We give the block a push and release it with a
velocity of 5 m/s. (a) Find the velocity, v(t), of the block.
(b) How long time does it take until the block stops?
(c) Write a program where you find v(t) numerically using Euler’s or Euler-Cromer’s
method. (Hint: You can find a program example in the textbook.) Use the program
to plot v(t) and compare with your analytical solution. Use a timestep of Δt = 0.01.
The description of friction provided above is too simplified. The coefficient of
friction is generally not independent of velocity. For dry friction, the coefficient of
friction can in some cases be approximated by the following formula:
μ(v) = μd + μs − μd
1 + v/v∗ , (4.83)
where μd = 0.1 often is called the dynamic coefficient of friction, μs = 0.2 is called
the static coefficient of friction, and v∗ = 0.5 m/s is a characteristic velocity for the
contact between the block and the surface.
(d) Show that the acceleration of the block is:
a(v) = −μd g − g μs − μd

Explain.
The model we have presented so far is only relevant at small velocities. At higher
velocities the snow or ice melts, and the coefficient of friction displays a different
dependency on velocity:

Chapter 5
Forces in One Dimension
What determines how far a bungee-jumper falls before he starts moving upward? In
this chapter you acquire the tools to answer this, sometimes critical, question.
We have introduced a structured approach to find the motion of a object from
its acceleration and the initial conditions (see Fig. 5.1). But how do we find the
acceleration? We could measure it directly, as we did with an accelerometer, but this
is not satisfactory. Physics is not only about describing what is happening, but rather
about explaining and predicting motion. In order to determine the motion, we need
to be able to predict the acceleration of an object.
In this chapter we will show you that the acceleration of an object is related to the
forces acting on the object. In order to predict the motion, we need to:
• Find what forces are acting on an object.
• Introduce quantitative models for the forces—we need numbers for the forces in
order to have numbers for the acceleration.
• Determine the acceleration from the forces using Newton’s second law of motion.
• “Solve” the motion from the differential equations of motion and the initial con-
ditions.
We will address these points in detail: First we show how to identify the forces
acting on an object. Then we introduce Newton’s second law that relates forces to
acceleration. Finally, we introduce models for some of the most common forces in
the macroscopic world.
5.1 What Is a Force?
We all have an intuitive notion of a force. Imagine you give one end of a soft rubber
band to a friend (see Fig. 5.2). As you pull the rubber band, your friend will experience
a pull in the rubber band. She feels the force acting on her. As you pull harder, she

will feel that the pull becomes stronger—the force acting on her becomes larger. In
addition, the rubber band stretches. The harder you pull, the longer the rubber band
becomes.
If you instead tie the rubber band to the wall, the rubber band will again elongate
as you pull. But now it is not a person experiencing the pull, it is the wall. A force
may indeed act on the wall as well as on a person. If we pull harder, the rubber band
elongates further, and we expect the force on the wall to become larger. This suggests
that the elongation of the band is a reasonable way to measure the magnitude of the
force, and this is indeed the usual way to define a force: by prescribing how we can
measure it. We can measure forces by how they deform rubber bands.
Now, there is nothing special about a rubber band. We could replace the rubber
band by a spring or any other material. As you pull on the spring, the spring elongates.
5.1 What Is a Force? 85
If the spring is stiff, it elongates less than the rubber band, but it still elongates
somewhat. A rope may be even stiffer, and would deform even less, but a careful
measurement would show that also a rope elongates when pulled.
We are nearing a definition of a force. We could define a force as an interaction—a
pull or a push on an object—that can be measured by the deformation of a spring. In
this case the magnitude of the force increases with the deformation of the spring. This
definition is not altogether satisfactory, but it illustrates a particular type of force—
what we call a contact force. Contact forces occur where an object is in contact with
other objects.
What about a book lying on a table, are there any forces acting on the book? The
book is not moving, so we may be tempted to say no. Unfortunately, this would be
wrong. When we pulled on the wall with the spring, the wall was not moving, but
there was still a force acting on it. What about the book—where are the forces acting
on the book? First, there is one force we have not discussed so far, the force of gravity.
This is one of the fundamental forces in nature: There are gravitation forces between
any two objects pulling the objects toward each other. There is a gravitational force
from the Earth on the book, which pulls the book downward.
What is stopping the book from moving? The table! But how? We cannot see
any deformation as we could for the rubber band. This is only because you do not
look carefully enough. If you zoomed in on the contact between the book and the
table using a microscope, you would see that the surface of the table and the surface
of the book are not flat, but rough. Small surface irregularities can be seen along
the surfaces. When the book is placed on the table, these small irregularities deform
(see Fig. 5.2). Each irregularity acts as a small spring, and when the irregularities are
deformed, that deformation is related to the contact force between the two objects.
The sum of the forces from all of these small springs is the force from the table on
the book.
If we zoom further in on the contact between one surface irregularity and the table,
we realize that the contact force really is a sum of electromagnetic forces between the
atoms on the surface of the book and the atoms on the surface of the table. The atoms
are never in actual contact, but as the book and the table are pressed toward each
other, electromagnetic forces will act from the table on the book. The electromagnetic
force has been shown to be part of the electromagnetic and the weak nuclear force,
which is one of three fundamental forces. The other two are gravity and the strong
nuclear force, which is responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles
and for the interactions in the nucleus. These are the three main forces in nature, and
all forces are reducible to these forces.
In most cases, we will study objects that consist of many atoms. In practice, we
cannot find the sum of the forces from all the individual atoms to find the magnitude
of the force, but we will instead develop simplified models for the macroscopic forces
we encounter. We will call such models force models, and they will be our main tools
for determining forces on macroscopic objects.

5.2 Identifying Forces
The first step in the “Model” box in our structured problem solving approach is to
find the forces acting on the object. We therefore need a systematic way to find and
identify the forces acting on an object, and we will do this by studying a specific
example: A ball bouncing on the ground, as illustrated in Fig. 5.3. In the process of
studying this example, we develop a general procedure for analyzing forces.
First, we need to discern between the object, also called the system, and the
environment, which is everything else. In this case, the system is the ball, and the
environment is everything else, such as the floor, the air surrounding the ball, and
the Earth. 1 We have now found the first step in our procedure:
1. Divide the problem into system and environment.
In order to find the forces acting, we must realize a fundamental characteristic of
a force:
All forces acting on the system must have a source—an identifiable cause in
the environment.
A force acting on the ball must be related to an interaction with something in the envi-
ronment. This also means that we do not consider internal forces—forces between
one part of the object and another part—we only consider external forces.
We have claimed that there are only three types of forces: gravity, the electromag-
netic and weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. However, this is not very
helpful for our analysis of a macroscopic object such as the ball. Instead, we will
divide forces into two main types:
Forces are either contact forces or long-range forces.
1 You will see that we need to include the Earth, since the gravitational force on the ball comes from
the interaction with the whole Earth, and not just with the floor.
5.2 Identifying Forces 87
Contact forces, as evident from the name, are forces that occur at the contact between
the system and the environment. We find contact forces by examining our drawing
of the ball in Fig. 5.3. From the drawing, we see that the ball is in contact with the
floor.
We generalize the procedure to find the contact points in the following steps:
2. Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object.
3. Draw a closed curve around the system.
4. Find contact points—these are the points where contact forces may act.
What is the contact force at this contact? The force on the ball is from the floor,
and we call this force the normal force. It is similar to the force acting on the book
lying on the table, and may be considered as a sum of many forces acting along the
interface between the ball and the floor. We introduce the symbol N for this force.
The symbol N represents a number (with a notation), giving the strength of the force.
(As we will see later, forces are measured in Newton, and N is therefore measured
in Newtons.) This step in the general procedure can be summarized as:
5. Give names and symbols to all the contact forces.
The direction of the normal force from the floor on the ball depends on the direction
of the floor as illustrated in Fig. 5.3d. In order to show both the direction and the
magnitude of the force, we realize that a force must be a vector, and we introduce
the symbol N for the normal force. To illustrate the normal force acting on the ball,
we draw a vector starting in the contact point, acting in the direction of the normal
force, and with a length related to its magnitude, as illustrated in Fig. 5.3c.
So far we have only discussed one of the contact forces between the ball and the
environment. What other contact forces are there? The ball is also in contact with the
air. The contact with the air results in several forces. Everywhere along the surface of
the ball there will be small drag forces because of the difference in velocity between
the surface of the ball and the air. Again, we simplify by assuming that all these small
forces sum to a single force, the air resistance, FD , which is drawn as acting in a
single point on the surface of the ball, as illustrated in Fig. 5.3c.
Similarly, there are differences in the pressure in the air, which would give rise to
a buoyancy force, B, which we again assume to be acting on the surface of the ball.
Finally, we must also look for the long-range forces affecting the ball. The only
long-range force is the gravitational force acting from the Earth on the ball. We call
this force, G, and draw it as acting in the center of the ball, in the direction toward
the center of the Earth.
This sums up the final step of our procedure:
6. Identify the long-range forces.
88 5 Forces in One Dimension
Free-Body Diagram
We have now defined a general procedure to find what we call the free-body diagram
for the system. This is a diagram that identifies all the forces acting on the object,
where each force is drawn as a vector starting from the point where the force is
acting. The construction of the free-body diagram is central to mechanics—and
it will typically be one of the first tasks you will do whenever you are solving a
mechanics problem. We will therefore provide you with a detailed prescription for
how to draw the free-body diagram.
Drawing a free-body diagram:
Follow these steps to find and identify all the forces acting on an object and
then to draw the free-body diagram for the system.
• Divide the problem into system and environment.
• Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object.
• Draw a closed curve around the system.
• Find contact points—these are the points where contact forces may act.
• Give names and symbols to all the contact forces.
• Identify the long-range forces.
• Make a drawing of the object. Draw the forces as arrows, vectors, starting
from where the force is acting. The direction of the vector indicates the
(positive) direction of the force. Try to make the length of the arrow indicate
the relative magnitude of the forces.
• Draw in the axes of the coordinate system. It is often convenient to make
one axis parallel to the direction of motion. When you choose direction of
the axis you also choose the positive direction for the axis.
Note that when you draw a force, you indicate the positive direction for this force.
If you later calculate the force and find that it is negative, it simply means that the
force is acting in the opposite direction of what you thought or defined as the positive
direction when you made the drawing. 2
5.3 Newton’s Second Law of Motion
We are now able to find and identify the forces acting on an object. However, we still
need a connection between the forces and the motion of an object. This connection
can be found through Newton’s second law of motion, which relates the acceleration
of an object to the forces acting on the object:
2 You should, however, be aware that in some cases, this may mean that you have made an error
in your assumptions, because some forces, such as the normal force due to a contact, cannot be
negative unless the objects are glued together.
5.3 Newton’s Second Law of Motion 89
Newton’s second law of motion: The force F on an object of inertial mass m
is related to the acceleration a of the object through F = ma.
Newton’s laws of motion are laws of nature that have been found by experimental
investigations and have been shown to hold up to continued experimental investi-
gations. Newton’s laws are valid over a wide range of length- and time-scales. We
use Newton’s laws of motion to describe everything from the motion of atoms to the
motion of galaxies.
Aspects of Newton’s Second Law
Vector equation: Newton’s second law is a vector equation: The acceleration is in
the direction of the force, and the acceleration is proportional to the force. In this
chapter, we will only study forces and motion in one dimension. We will therefore
write F = Fx i, where i is the unit vector along the x-axis. The one-dimensional
version of Newton’s second law is then:
Fx = ma x = m d2 x
dt2 . (5.1)
Intertial mass: Newton’s second law introduces a new property of an object—the
inertial mass, m. We determine the inertial mass of an object by measuring the
acceleration for a given applied force. The inertial mass is measured in Grams, with
the notation g. Experimental studies show that inertial masses are additive: If we add
two objects of masses m A and m B together, their total inertial mass is:
m = m A + m B . (5.2)
Unit: Forces are measured in Newton, with the notation N. The definition of one
Newton is that it is the force that gives an object with (inertial) mass of 1 kg an
acceleration of 1 m/s 2 . That is:
1 N = 1 kg m/s2 . (5.3)
Net external force: The force, F, in Newton’s second law is the net external force
acting on the object. By external we mean that the force has a cause outside the
system, as we insisted when we drew a free-body diagram of an object. By net force
we mean that if there are several forces acting on an object, it is the sum of all the
external forces that causes the acceleration. We call this sum the net force:
Fnet = ∑
j
F j = ma . (5.4)
90 5 Forces in One Dimension
Here we have written a sum over various forces, where each force is identified by a
subindex j. This is a typical way of writing the net force in shorthand. In practice, we
replace the sum, ∑
j , by a sum of each of the external forces found in the free-body
diagram.
For example, for the ball bouncing off the floor studied above, the net force on
the ball is:
Fnet = ∑
j
F j = G + N + FD + B . (5.5)
Superposition: Forces are additive. We say that they obey the superposition princi-
ple. The acceleration due to many forces, Fi , is the same as the acceleration of one
force equal to the sum of all the small forces.
Point particles: Newton’s second law applies to a point particle, an object located
in a single point. The acceleration a is the acceleration of this point. While the
concept of a point particle is mathematically useful, it is not that useful in a world of
macroscopic objects that have spatial extent, such as any object we typically describe
in mechanics.
Can we still use Newton’s second law for extended objects? Yes! Newton’s second
law is valid for the motion of any macroscopic object—even objects that deform or
change during the motions, such as bouncing football. But for a macroscopic object
we need to be very precise in how we describe the position of the object, because the
position is a single point whereas the object is located in many points. What point
to choose? It turns out that Newton’s second law is valid if we choose a particular
point called the center of mass of the object (or any point on the object that does not
move relative to the center of mass). We will introduce the center of mass formally
later, but for now we can use the (geometric) center of the object or any other point
that does not move relative to the center.
Because we can use Newton’s second law for both point particles and extended
objects, we do not need to discern between point particles and extended objects for
now. Usually, we find it most convenient to work with real, extended physical objects,
and we draw forces onto the extended objects, as shown in Fig. 5.3.
5.3.1 Example: Acceleration and Forces on a Lunar Lander
This example demonstrates how we can find forces from the acceleration, both in the
case where the net force is zero and where the acceleration is measured.
You are leading a team that is building the return module for the next lunar
expedition. You have designed a module that breaches if exposed to air resistance
forces above 10 6 N for more than 5 s. The mass of the module is 5000 kg. To test
your design you are using a numerical model that models the entry of the lander
into the Earth’s atmosphere. The result of such a simulation is in the form of the

Free-body diagram: We illustrate the descent of the module in a sketch, as shown
in Fig. 5.4. Our system is the module, and we describe its vertical position by y(t).
We draw the system alone in a separate figure in order to draw the free-body
diagram. The module is in contact with the surrounding air, giving rise to the air drag
force, FD , which acts upward when the module is moving downward. This is the
only contact force. In addition, it is affected by a long-range force—the gravitational
force from the Earth, G, which acts downward toward the Earth.
Newton’s second law: The net force on the module is:
Fnet = FD + G , (5.6)
where FD acts upward when the module is moving downward, hence FD = F D j,
and G acts downward, that is, in the negative y-direction, G = −Gj:
Fnet = (F D − G) i . (5.7)
We remove the vector notation since we are looking at motion along the y-axis,
getting the net force along the y-axis:
Fnet = F D − G , (5.8)
which is the equation you will usually start from—we do not usually include the
whole vector notation derivation when discussing a one-dimensional problem.
Newton’s second law for motion along the y-axis gives:
Fnet = F D − G = ma y , (5.9)
3 http://folk.uio.no/malthe/mechbook.
92 5 Forces in One Dimension
since we know a y (ti ) at given times ti , we may use this relation to find F D (ti ) at the
same time intervals, if we only knew G(ti ).
Measuring the gravitational force: To determine G(ti ), we need a force model—
a model that gives us a number value (and unit) for the gravitational force. You
probably already know this law, G = mg, and we will introduce it later on—but
what could you do if you did not know it? We could device a experiment to measure
the gravitational force G on the module. We hang the module in a wire, and measure
the force in the wire when the module is at rest. This is the principle behind a weight.
Figure 5.4c illustrates the free-body diagram for this experiment. Since the module
is not moving the only contact force is T, the force from the wire on the module.
Newton’s second law in the y-direction becomes:
Fnet = T − G = ma y . (5.10)
However, we have designed this experiment so that a y = 0 m/s 2 , since the module
is not moving, therefore
T − G = 0 ⇒ T = G . (5.11)
We have found that we can measure G by measuring T , which gives T = G =
49,000 N.
You will find that this use of Newton’s second law is very common, and we will
return to it many times. Problems where there is no motion—or motion with constant
velocity—are often called static problems.
Calculating air resistance force: Since we now know that G = 49,000 N (and we
assume this is a constant throughout the motion), we can now use the data we have for
a y (ti ) for the module to find the air resistance force on the module. From Newton’s
second law we have:
F D − G = ma y ⇒ F D = G + ma y , (5.12)
Since the acceleration is changing throughout the motion, the air resistance force F D
is also a function of time. We read the accelerations from the file reentry.d 4 using the
following program.
t,a = loadtxt(’reentry.d’,unpack=True)
W = 49000.0 # N
m = 5000.0 # kg
D = W + m*a plot(t,D)
xlabel(’t [s]’)
ylabel(’D [N]’)
Analysis: We see from the plot of F D (t) in Fig. 5.5 that while F D is decreasing, it is
larger than the limit for more than 5 s. With this entry, the hull will breach!

Additional material: We can find the time when the air resistance force becomes
less than F C
D = 10 6 N, by first finding the smallest i where F D (ti ) is less than F C
D ,
and then finding the corresponding ti . This is done by:
>> i = min(find(FD<1e6))
>> ti = t[i]
ti = 5.4246
This shows that the air resistance force falls to F C
D after 5.42 s. The module needs
to be redesigned. You may get ideas as to how when you learn about air resistance
later in this chapter.
5.4 Force Models
In order to use Newton’s second law to determine the acceleration of an object, we
need to find out how large a force is—we need to determine its magnitude and direc-
tion. For this, we need theories that provide numerical values for the forces. We call
such models “force models”. The force models may be based on direct, experimental
measurements. We often call such models phenomenological or experimental force
models. The force models can also be based on a more fundamental model or a model
based on a microscopic view of the interactions.
In the following we introduce models for some of the most common types of
forces acting between macro- and microscopic objects. These models will be your
toolbox for addressing physical processes—you need to continually build on this
toolbox, as this will be your reservoir of physical knowledge. If you want to describe
a ball falling through air, you need mathematical expressions for the forces on the
ball: both the force due to gravity and the force due to air resistance. If you want to
describe the motion of a nanometer sized particle in water close to a charged surface
you need to introduce (probably sophisticated) models for the forces between the
particle and the individual water molecules and between the particle and the surface.
94 5 Forces in One Dimension
The range of problems you can solve depends on your knowledge of interactions—
forces—and on your ability to simplify a complicated situation to a model that only
contains forces you know how to address.
5.5 Force Model: Gravitational Force
Another of Newton’s great accomplishments is his discovery of the law of gravity.
According to Newton’s law of gravity, there are attractive, gravitational forces
between all objects. The gravitational force on object A from object B is:
Ffrom B on A = γ m · M
r3
AB
rAB , (5.13)
Here rAB is a vector pointing from the center of object A to the center of object B, and
r AB is the length of this vector, corresponding to the distance between the centers of
objects A and B (see Fig. 5.6). The quantities m and M are the gravitational masses
of objects A and B respectively, and γ is the gravitational constant.
All experimental evidence shows that the gravitational masses are the same as the
inertial masses. We will therefore use the same symbol, m for both the inertial mass
and the gravitational mass of an object.
Constant Gravity
The general gravitational law becomes simpler for an object near the surface of the
Earth or another planet. In this case, the distance r AB from the object to the center
of the Earth is approximately constant and equal to the radius R of the Earth. The
gravitational force can therefore be approximated by:

j = −mg j , (5.14)
where the unit vector j points in the upward direction, and g is called the
acceleration of gravity .
The constant g only depends on the radius and mass of the planet.
The Acceleration of Gravity
Why do we call g the acceleration is gravity? Because this is the acceleration of an
object that is subject only to a gravitational force, which is easily seen from Newton’s
second law applied to an object only affected by gravity:
ma = G = −mg j , (5.15)
a = −g j , (5.16)
For an object on the surface of the Earth, the acceleration of gravity is approximately
g = 9.81 m/s 2 , whereas for an object on the surface of the Moon, the acceleration
of gravity is gm = 0.17 g. You can find a table of the acceleration of gravity on the
surface of various objects in the solar system in Table 5.1.

There are local variations of g along the Earth’s surface due to deviations of the
spherical shape of the Earth, due to topographical variations, and due to differences
in density in the Earth’s crust. In addition, there are variations in the effective g due
to the rotation of the Earth. Surveys of variations in g due to density differences in
the crust are used as a remote sensing technique that gives important information
about the properties of rocks present in the Earth’s crust. This technique is routinely
used for example for petroleum exploration.
5.6 Force Model: Viscous Force
You will often encounter objects that are in contact with a surrounding fluid such
as a air or water. We therefore need a force model for the interaction between fluids
and solid objects. Unfortunately, there is no fundamental law of nature for such
an interaction. Instead, we must determine the force model from experiments or
calculations based on an underlying model for fluid flow, and use this result as our
model. Fortunately, experiments and calculations show that the force from the fluid
has a simple form—it depends on the velocity of the object.
Drag Force at Low Velocities
If you pull a sphere through water, you expect a contact force F D from the water
on the sphere counteracting the motion of the sphere relative to water because water
is forced to flow around the sphere. Both experiments and theoretical models show
that for low velocities the fluid flows smoothly around the object (see Fig. 5.7), and
the force, F D , from the fluid is proportional to the velocity of the object relative to
the fluid.
The viscous force on an object moving at a velocity v relative to a fluid is:
F D = −k v v , (5.17)
where k v is a constant that depends on the objects size, shape and surface, as well as
on the (dynamic) viscosity of the fluid. Stokes showed that at low velocities
k v = 6πηR , (5.18)
where R is the radius of the sphere and η is the viscosity of the fluid. The viscosity
of air is η = 1.82 × 10−5 Nsm−2 (at room temperature), and the viscosity of water
is η = 1.00 × 10−3 Nsm−2 (at room temperature).

Fig. 5.7 Illustration of a drag force on an object due to the motion of the object relative to the
surrounding fluid. At low velocities the fluid flow around the object is smooth, and the force is
approximately proportional to the velocity. At higher velocities, the fluid flow becomes turbulent
near the surface, the flow becomes irregular, and the force is approximately proportional to the
square of the velocity
We call a force that is proportional to the velocity (of the object) a viscous force.
If the force is a contact force from a fluid we also often use the term drag force to
describe the interaction.
Drag Force at High Velocities
At larger velocities the fluid flow around the object becomes more irregular (see
Fig. 5.7), and the drag force is not mainly related to the forces required to drag
the fluid along the surface of the object, but instead depends on the under-pressure
generated behind the object. In this case, the force is proportional to the square of
the velocity, and we call this law the square law of air resistance.
The drag force on an object moving at a velocity v relative to a fluid is:
F D = −Dv2 , (5.19)
acting in the direction opposite the velocity.
The minus sign shows that the force acts in the direction opposite the velocity. The
prefactor D is a constant that depends on the objects size, shape and surface, and

the density of the fluid. Experimental data gives an approximative value for D for a
spherical object:
D  12.0 ρ R2 . (5.20)
where ρ is the density of the fluid, and R is the radius of the sphere.
General Model for Fluid Drag
The behaviors for low and high velocities are special cases of a more general model
for the drag force. Experiments show that the drag force can be written in the general
form:
F D = 1
2 ρ S C D (v, η, ρ, d)v2 , (5.21)
where ρ is the density of the fluid. For air ρ = 1.293 kg/m 3 at normal pressures and
temperatures. S is the cross-sectional area of the object—that means the area of the
object’s projection on a plane normal to the direction of motion. For a sphere with
radius r the cross-sectional area is S = πr2 . The speed of the object relative to the
fluid is v. The viscosity of the fluid is η, and d is a characteristic length scale, such
as the diameter of a sphere. The coefficient C D (. . .) is called the drag coefficient
and describes the details of the air resistance—the physics of drag is hidden in this
function. For a given object type—such as a sphere of a given material—experiments
show a remarkable feature: The drag coefficient only depends on one number, Re,
called the Reynold’s number:
C D (v, η, ρ, d) = C D (Re) , Re = ρd
η v . (5.22)
This is a surprisingly compact description with many interesting implications. For
example, if you increase the velocity by a factor 10 you get the same drag coefficient
if you either reduce the radius by a factor 10 or increase the viscosity by a factor 10.
The general function for the drag coefficient, C D (Re), for a smooth sphere is shown
in Fig. 5.8. (You can find the data-set for part (a) in cdreynolds.d 5 ).
For small velocities, we expect to recover Stokes’ general result: F D = 6πηRv,
which implies that C D (Re) ∝ Re−1 for small v (and Re). This is indeed what we
observe in Fig. 5.8, where Re−1 is shown as a straight line. For large velocities,
we see that the drag coefficient becomes approximately constant, and the force is
therefore proportional to the square of the velocity. Our simplified models for small
and large velocities are therefore consistent with the experimental results, and we

Re  1 and large means Re  1000.
Something strange happens when the Reynold’s number reaches Re = 3.2 ×
10 5 : The drag coefficient drops significantly! A careful calculation (which you can
program yourself) shows that not only the drag coefficient but also the fluid drag
force falls. How can the drag force decrease when the velocity increases? This effect
is due to boundary-layer turbulence (which we will not explain here). The transition
point where this effect kicks in depends on surface properties of the object. For a
rough surface, such as that of a golf ball, the transition occurs for a lower Reynolds
number than for a smooth ball. This is the reason why golf balls have a rough surface:
The air drag force for large velocities is reduced by this design.
What happened to aerodynamic design? This is also hidden in the drag coefficient.
The value of the drag coefficient depends on the shape of the object, and more
aerodynamic designs have lower drag coefficients for approximately the same cross-
sectional area, as illustrated in Fig. 5.8.
5.6.1 Example: Falling Raindrops
This example demonstrates how we can find the motion of an object subject to a
constant force (gravity), and to a velocity-dependent force.
Raindrops are often as small as d = 1mm in diameter as they start falling. Here,
we apply the structured problem-solving approach to find their velocity, first without
air resistance, and then with a model for viscous drag.
Sketch and Identify: We always start addressing a problem through a sketch which
should include the system, a raindrop, the environment, and a coordinate system (see
Fig. 5.9). We describe the position of the raindrop by its vertical position y(t) as a
function of time t.

Model: The motion of the raindrop is determined by the forces acting on it. We
draw the forces in a free-body diagram, as illustrated in Fig. 5.9. The sketch shows
that the raindrop is only in contact with the surrounding air, which gives rise to an
air resistance force F D . In addition, the raindrop is affected by gravity, G, from the
Earth.
We have force models for each of these forces. We know that gravity is G = −mgj,
where m is the mass of the raindrop. For the air resistance F D we assume that we
can use the viscous law:
FD = −k v v(t) j , (5.23)
where v(t) is the velocity of the drop. You should check with yourself that this force
indeed has the correct sign. Remember that when the drop falls downward its velocity
is negative.
Newton’s second law: We apply Newton’s second law to find the acceleration of the
drop:
Fnet = FD + G = −mg j − k v v(t) j = ma j , (5.24)
which corresponds to
− mg − k v v(t) = ma . (5.25)
We lack two of the numbers in this equation: m and k v. We can find the mass of the
drop by assuming that it is spherical and made of water. The volume of a sphere is
V = (4π/3)r3 , where r = d/2 is the radius of the sphere, and the mass density of
water is ρ = 1000.0 kg/m 3 . The mass of the drop is therefore
m = ρ V = ρ 4π
3 r3 = ρ 4π
3
( d

= 5.24 × 10−7 kg . (5.26)
We find k v from Stokes’ formula in (5.18): k v = 6π Rη. The radius of the raindrop
is r = 0.5 × 10−3 m, and the viscosity of the air is η = 1.82 × 10−5 Nsm−2 . This
gives k v = 1.85 × 10−7 Nsm−1 .
5.6 Force Model: Viscous Force 101
Finally, to calculate the motion of the drop, we need to know its initial conditions:
It starts from y(0) = h at t = 0 s at rest, that is, with v(0) = 0 m/s.
Simplified model: No air resistance: First, what happens in the simplified case when
we have no air resistance? In that case, k v = 0, and the acceleration is a constant
a = −g . (5.27)
We find the velocity as function of time by direct integration:
v(t) − v(0) =
∫ t
0
a dt = −gt . (5.28)
This corresponds to a free fall, as we have seen previously. We expect this to only
be a good approximation as long as the air resistance term is small, that is as long as
k v v(t) is much smaller than mg, that is when
k v v  mg ⇒ v  mg
k v
= 5.24 × 10−7 kg 9.8 m/s 2
1.85 × 10−7 Nsm−1  27.8 m/s. (5.29)
We will check how good this approximation is further on.
Simplified model: Constant velocity: What will happen as the drop starts to fall? It
starts from zero velocity, hence the initial acceleration will be a = −g − (k v/m)v =
−g. As the drop falls, the velocity becomes a negative number, but with increasing
magnitude. The acceleration, a = −g − (k v/m)v will therefore approach zero.
However, if the acceleration becomes zero, the velocity will no longer change, and
the drop will have reached a stationary velocity—a velocity that does not change
with time. This occurs when
a = −g − k v
m v = 0 ⇒ −g = k v
m v ⇒ v = − mg
k v
. (5.30)
We call this velocity the terminal velocity, v T :
v T = mg
k v
. (5.31)
We therefore expect the drop to approach the velocity v = −v T as time increases.
Full model: Numerical solution: We now know both the initial behavior, a = −g,
and the asymptotic behavior, a → 0 m/s 2 , v → −v T . We can find the velocity by
solving
a = dv
dt = −g − k v

with initial conditions v(t0) = 0 m/s using Euler’s method:
v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + Δt · a(ti , v(ti )) . (5.33)
This method is implemented in the following program:
from pylab import *
#
# Physical variables

kv = 1.85e-7 # Nsmˆ-2
m = 5.2e-7 # kg

# Numerical initialization
n = int(round(time/dt))
v = zeros(n,float)
a = zeros(n,float)
t = zeros(n,float)
# Set initial values
v[0] = v0
# Integration loop
for i in range(n-1):
a[i] = -g - (kv/m)*v[i]
v[i+1] = v[i] + a[i]*dt
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
Analysis of numerical solution: The resulting plot of v(t) and a(t) is shown in
Fig. 5.10. We see that both v(t) and a(t) behaves as we expected. The drop starts
with zero velocity and an initial acceleration of −g. The acceleration reduces as
the velocity increases and the drop reaches a stationary state where it moves with
constant velocity. We compare with the two simplified models. The behavior without
air resistance is plotted as a dashed line, and it is indeed a reasonable approximation
for small velocities, that is when |v|  v T = 27.5 m/s. For long times the velocity
approaches v → −v T , which is illustrated by the dotted line in the plot. The simplified
solutions are therefore useful to check if our numerical solution is correct.
Full model: Analytical solution: Now that we have both found the simplified and
the numerical solution, we are ready to attempt an analytical soultion. In this case

we are fortunate, since the particular equation in (5.32) can be solved analytically

Python can then solve the equation with the initial condition by

This corresponds to the solution
v(t) = v T

In most cases, machines are much better than humans at integration. In your
career as a physicist it is therefore more important to be able to formulate problems
so that they can be solved numerically or symbolically than to be able to solve them
analytically yourself.
Test your understanding: What would happen if the drop started with a velocity v0 = −2v T ?

5.7 Force Model: Spring Force
The two most common contact forces for a macroscopic object are due to
• contact with a fluid or
• contact with another solid.
We have seen that we can use a velocity-dependent force to model fluid-solid contacts.
What about solid-solid contacts? The contact forces between two solid objects come
from the deformation of the objects (and from surface forces such as adhesion and
friction, but we will address such effects later). How can we model contact forces
due to deformation?
Spring Force
First, we can measure the force due to deformation directly. Figure 5.11 illustrates
an experiment where we pull a rubber band and measure the force needed to extend
the band a distance ΔL. Figure 5.11 shows that the force, F increases linearly with
ΔL:
The force F required to extend an object by ΔL is the spring force:
F = kΔL , (5.40)
This relationship is valid for small deformations ΔL for practically all materials.

Fig. 5.12 Illustration of a stiff spring (1) and a weak spring (2) extended by the same length ΔL
(on the left), and affected by the same force F (on the right)
Why do we call this force a spring force? Because a coiled spring is constructed
so that the deformation force is proportional to the extension ΔL also for large
extensions. Coiled springs are commonly used in experimental demonstrations and
in many mechanical devices. Here, we usually base our discussions on the behavior
of a spring, but keep in mind that the results are valid for the deformation of any
object as long as the deformation is small compared to the size of the object.
Spring constant, k : The constant k is called the spring constant, which is the slope
of the F(ΔL) curve. Figure 5.12 shows the behavior for a weak spring (1) and for
a stiff spring (2). The stiff spring has a larger spring constant than the weak spring,
k2 > k1 .
If we want both springs to extend the same length ΔL, we need to apply a larger
force to the stiffer spring than to the weaker spring: F2 > F1 (see left side in figure).
If we apply the same force to both springs, the weak spring extends further than
the stiff spring: ΔL1 > ΔL2 (see right side in figure). This is consistent with our
intuition: If we pull with the same force on a rubber band and on a stiff rope, the
rubber band deforms more than the rope. Hence the rubber band has a smaller spring
constant than the rope.
The spring constant characterizes a particular object. If we redo the experiment
with the same spring, we find the same spring constant every time.
106 5 Forces in One Dimension
Elongation, ΔL: A physical object such as a spring has a non-zero length when it
is not stretched. We call this length the equilibrium length, L0 , of the spring. The
elongation of the spring is the difference between the length of the spring, L, and the
equilibrium length L0 :
ΔL = L − L0 . (5.41)
Various elongations are illustrated in Fig. 5.12. If the spring is stretched, ΔL is
positive. We usually assume that a spring can be also compressed, even if this may
not be physically realistic. (You cannot really compress a rope, it will buckle instead).
For a compressed spring, the length of the spring is smaller than the equilibrium
length, and ΔL is negative.
Sign: You have to determine the sign in front of kΔL in (5.40) using your physical
intuition. It is not that difficult: All you have to remember is that in order to extend
the spring, you need to pull at the spring in the direction you extend it.
Spring-Block Models
We now know that the force required to extend a spring a length ΔL is F = kΔL.
How can we use this to determine the motion of an object attached to a spring? In
Fig. 5.13, we have illustrated two general cases: A block attached to a spring, and a
ball in contact with a spring. Both objects slide on a frictionless surface, so that there
are no other horizontal forces: The only horizontal force acting on the block (ball)
is from the spring.
A Block Attached to a Spring
The force, F, on the block from the spring is the same as the force acting on the
spring from the block, but it has the opposite direction. (Later, when we introduce
Newton’s third law, we see that these forces are action-reaction pairs.)
F(ΔL) = −kΔL . (5.42)
The sign is chosen so that when the spring is extended—it is longer than in
equilibrium—the force is negative, that it, the force acts in the negative x-direction.
We describe the position of the block by the position, x, of the left-hand side of
the block, where it is attached to the spring. The other end of the spring is attached
to a wall at x = 0. The extension of the spring depends on the position of the block:
ΔL = L − L0 , (5.43)
where L = (x − 0) = x is the length of the spring.

Fig. 5.13 Illustration of the force on a block attached to a spring (left), and on a ball colliding with
(but not attached to) a spring (right)
The force F on the block consequently depends on the position of the block:
F = F(x) = −k (x − L0) . (5.44)
The spring force acting on an object attached to the spring is therefore an
example of a position-dependent force.
Why is it important if a force is position-dependent? Because this means that the
position occurs on both sides of the equation of motion following from Newton’s
second law:
F = ma ⇒ a = d2 x
dt2 = − k
m (x − L0) . (5.45)
We need to solve a differential equation to determine the motion of the block.
108 5 Forces in One Dimension
This also illustrates another important lesson: If the force model includes variables
that change during motion, we need to rewrite the force model to include the position
of the object. A common mistake is to stop at (5.42), where the force, F(L), depends
on the length L, and not realize that L is a function of the position, L = L(x), and
that the equation must be solved as a differential equation.
A Ball Colliding with a Spring
The ball in Fig. 5.13 is not attached to the spring—it is not glued to the spring as
the block was. The ball is therefore only affected by the spring force as long as the
spring is compressed, that is, when ΔL < 0. We must rewrite the force model to
reflect this:
F(ΔL) =
{ −kΔL , ΔL < 0
0 , ΔL ≥ 0 (5.46)
The rest of the analysis is exactly the same as for the ball: The spring force is position
dependent, and can be written as:
F(ΔL) =
{ −k (x − L0) , x < L0
0 , x ≥ L0 (5.47)
Notice that this force model is non-linear and the problem therefore requires special
consideration when you solve it: You must remember that the force is zero as soon
as the ball loses contact with the spring.
Notice also that the ball-spring contact is a lot like the normal force. This is not
a coincidence. The spring-ball model is actually our simplest model for the normal
force, as we discuss in the following section, and the spring-block model is the
simplest model for a contact force between two attached objects. These are probably
the models you will use the most during your physics studies.
Contact Forces
The spring force was introduced as an approximative model for the force due to
deformation. It is based on experimental evidence: We find the law by measuring
the force as a function of the deformation. And the law is surprisingly versatile: We
can use it as a model for almost any contact force between solid objects. Let us see
exactly how we map a complicated, realistic deformation problem onto the simplified
spring model description.
Figure 5.14 shows a computer simulation of a collision between a soft, round disk
and a solid wall that does not deform. The top figures show the deformation of the
ball, where the colors indicate the magnitude of the forces inside the disk. During the
collision, the ball is deformed, but how do we measure the extent of deformation?
The simplest approach is to look at how much the ball has changed from its original,

from the wall on the ball as a function of displacement. Bottom Illustration of how the displacement
ΔL is measured, and an illustration of the spring-block model used to represent the soft ball
round shape. This measurement of ΔL is illustrated in the bottom figures, where we
see that the original shape overlaps with the wall, and we define ΔL as the length of
this overlap. The middle figure shows the force from the wall on the ball as a function
of deformation, ΔL, and it is indeed a linear function, F = kΔL, as we found for a
spring!
We can therefore use the spring model as a model for the deformation of a ball, or
as a first approximation for the deformation of any deforming object. In this case we
say that we use the spring model as an approximative model for the contact force.
In the bottom of Fig. 5.14 we illustrate that we model the contact between the disk
and the floor by representing the disk as a mass located at the center of the sphere
connected to a massless spring of length L0 = R equal to the radius of the sphere.
We may also express the force in terms of the position x of the center of the ball.
We notice that the spring is compressed, ΔL = L − L0 = x − R < 0, during
the collision, and we expect the force on the ball to act upward while the ball is
compressed, hence:
F = −kΔL = −k (x − R) , (5.48)
is the force on the ball from the wall.
110 5 Forces in One Dimension
Generally, we do not know what the spring constant will be for such a model.
We need either to measure the spring constant or to find the spring constant from
a theoretical consideration based on for example elasticity theory. You must also
ensure that you use a reasonable version of the spring model. For example, for the
collision between a ball and a wall in Fig. 5.14, where the ball does not adhere to the
wall, we must use a spring-ball model without attachment.
We can use the spring model both when the object itself is deformed, as illustrated
in Fig. 5.14, as well as when the wall deforms while the ball remains practically
undeformed—a steel ball bouncing on a mattress, or when both the ball and the wall
deforms.
Test your understanding: How would you represent the force between an undeformable ball and
a deformable surface? Make a drawing, and show how you introduce the spring that models the
deformation.
Normal and Contact Forces
The force from the wall on the ball is the normal force on the ball. However, a normal
force only acts as long as the objects are in contact.
We can model a normal force between two objects using a spring model:
F =
{ kΔL while in contact
0 otherwise , (5.49)
where ΔL describes the deformation of the two objects.
For the ball in Fig. 5.14 the normal force F is:
F =
{ −k(x − R) , x < R
0 , x ≥ R . (5.50)
We can use this force model to find the motion of a bouncing ball if we also include the
effect of gravity, G = mg. (We assume air resistance is negligible). The acceleration
is then found from:
a = 1
m Fnet = F − G , (5.51)
and the resulting motion is illustrated in Fig. 5.15.
The normal force only acts when two objects are pressed together. On the other
hand, if the objects are attached to each other, the contact force acts both when the
objects are pressed together and when they are pulled apart. Examples of attached
objects are: two objects that are glued or welded together or attached by surface
forces such as adhesion, two parts of one larger solid body such as the two lobes on
a dumbbell, or two atoms in a diatomic molecule.

We can model an attachment force between two objects using a spring model:
F = kΔL , (5.52)
where ΔL represents the elongation of the contact, which is typically equal to
the change in distance between the centers of the two objects in contact.
General Position-Dependent Force
The spring model is not only a model for the deformation of springs. It is an extremely
versatile model that provides a good description of the deformation of almost any
object, spanning length scales from the deformation of the Earth’s surface to the
deformation of objects only a few atom diameters in size. It describes the deformation
of rubber bands, strings, wires, wheels, bars, and the interactions between molecules
and atoms. However, the spring model is typically only valid for small deformations:
the deformation should be small compared to the size of the system.
The spring model is probably the most powerful and common model for interac-
tions that you will encounter in physics. Why is that? Because many types of forces
depend on the position of an object relative to another object: Contact forces, grav-
itational forces, electromagnetic forces, and inter-atomic forces all depend on the
112 5 Forces in One Dimension
position, x, of the object they act on: F = F(x). For motion near a point x = b, we
can approximate the force on the object with Taylor’s formula for F(x):
F(x) = F(b) + F′(b)(x − b) + O(x − b)2 . (5.53)
The force on the object at a position x near b, that is when (x − b) is small, can be
approximated by the first order term:
F(x)  F(b) + F′(b)(x − b) . (5.54)
This force model has the same form as the contact force model in (5.50) except for
the constant F(b). However, in most cases we measure the displacement from an
equilibrium position where no force is acting and therefore F(b) = 0.
The spring model corresponds to a Taylor expansion of a position-dependent
force F(x) around an equilibrium point, b:
F(x)  F′(b) (x − b) = k (x − b) (5.55)
where k = F′(b).
For example, for the ball in contact with the wall in Fig. 5.14, the deformation of
the ball is small, and we can use the spring model as an approximation to the real
deformation force.
5.7.1 Example: Motion of a Hanging Block
This example demonstrates how we can find the motion of an object affected by a
spring force, using both numerical and analytical methods. The methods introduced
can be applied to find the behavior of an object subject to any type of position-
dependent force.
A block of mass m = 1 kg is hanging from a spring with spring constant k =
100 N/m. The other end of the spring is attached to the ceiling. We apply the structured
problem-solving approach to find the motion of the block after it is released, and then
make the model more realistic by adding air resistance.
Sketch and Identify: The system is the block, and the environment consists of the
spring, the ceiling, the ground, and the surrounding air. The motion of the block is
illustrated in Fig. 5.16, where x(t) is used to describe the position of the block.
Model: We use the free-body diagram in Fig. 5.16 to identify the forces acting on
the block: It is affected by a contact force, F, from the spring, air resistance, FD , and
gravity G = −mgj. We use a spring force model for the force from the spring:

(right)
F = ±kΔL , (5.56)
where the elongation ΔL depends on the position, y, of the block. For simplicity,
we place the coordinate system so that the spring is in equilibrium when y = 0 m,
so that y = ΔL as illustrated in Fig. 5.16. If the block is pulled down in the negative
y-direction, the spring will act to pull the block up in the positive direction, therefore
the correct sign of the spring force is:
F(y) = −ky j . (5.57)
Newton’s second law: Newton’s second law along the y-axis gives
Fnet = F + G + FD = F j + G j + F D j = ma j , (5.58)
where we remove the vectors to get:
Fnet = F + F D + G = −ky + F D − mg = ma . (5.59)
Equilibrium model: First, let us consider the equilibrium situation—where the block
does not move when released. Since the block does not move, air resistance is zero,
F D = 0, and the acceleration is also zero, which gives:
− ky + F D − mg = −ky − mg = ma = 0 , (5.60)
114 5 Forces in One Dimension
which gives
yeq = − mg
k , (5.61)
for the equilibrium position of the block.
What would you expect to happen if you instead released the block from a position
above this equilibrium position? We would expect the block to oscillate, but the oscil-
lations would grow smaller, and the block would eventually stop at the equilibrum
position. Does our model system reproduce this behavior?
Simplified model—No air resistance: We start from a simplified model, where we
assume that air resistance is negligible, so that F D = 0. From (5.59) we see that the
acceleration is
a = d2 x
dt2 = −g − k
m y , (5.62)
and the block starts at rest, v(t0) = 0 m/s, at y(t0) = 0 m, where t0 = 0 s.
Simplified model—Numerical solution: We can find the motion of the block using
an Euler-Cromer scheme. Generally, we advice you to use a fourth-order Runge-
Kutta method for oscillator problems, but we use Euler-Cromer here to make the
programming transparent. (Notice that the direct Euler scheme is not stable for this
equation). The Euler-Cromer scheme for (5.62) reads:
v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) − k
m x(ti ) − g Δt (5.63)
x(ti + Δt) = x(ti ) + v(ti + Δt) Δt
which is implemented in the following program:
from pylab import *
# Initialize
m = 1.0 # kg
k = 100.0 # N/m
v0 = 1.0 # in m/s
time = 2.0 # s
g = 9.8 # m/sˆ2
# Numerical setup
dt = 0.0001 # s
n = int(round(time/dt))
t = zeros(n,float)
y = zeros(n,float)
v = zeros(n,float)
# Initial values
y[0] = 0.0
v[0] = v0
# Simulation loop for i in range(n-1):
F = -k*y[i] - m*g
a = F/m
v[i+1] = v[i] + a*dt
y[i+1] = y[i] + v[i+1]*dt
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt

the spring force and blue arrow shows gravity
Here we chose a particular value for the time step, Δt, but how was this value chosen?
Generally, we try to choose Δt as small as is practically possible: Small enough to
ensure that the error is small, but not so small that the calculation takes too long time.
In this case, the time step must be much smaller than time it takes for the block to
swing back a forth one time, otherwise the results will not make any sense. However,
it is a good rule to check your results by reducing your time-step by a factor 10 and
observing if your solution is stable to such a change.
While the resulting motion is illustrated in the plots in Fig. 5.17, the motion
becomes clearer by visualizing the dynamics using the simplest possible tool: the
plotting function. We use a sequence of plot commands to give an impression of
the dynamics by adding the following program lines
for ii in range(n-1):
subplot(2,1,1)
plot(t,y,’-b’,t[ii],y[ii],’ob’);
xlabel(’t [s]’)
ylabel(’y [m]’)
subplot(2,1,2)
plot(t,v,’-b’,t[ii],v[ii],’ob’);
xlabel(’t [s]’)
ylabel(’v [m/s]’)
116 5 Forces in One Dimension
Notice that we are not showing every time step, but jump in steps of 10 using
range(0,n−1,10) in the for-loop. You should tune this to a number that
gives a suitable dynamics on your computer. Using this tool, you can build your intu-
ition of the impact of various variables. For example, you can check what happens if
you change the initial velocity, v0 , or the spring constant k, for example, you could
try changing the initial velocity to v0 = −0.1 m/s, or you could set y0 = 0.1 m and
v0 = 0.0 m/s.
If you want to make a more dynamic visualization of the motion of the block
you can use the VPython tools, which allows you to make real-time graphical
visualizations of the motion. We provide a simple program example to show how
you can visualize and control the motion of an object using VPython:
from numpy import *
from visual import *
ipos = 0 dt = 0.001 # in s
m = 0.1 # in kg
k = 20.0 # in N/m
d = 0.1 # in m
x = 0.1
v = 0.1
# Initialize display
L = 0.02, H = 0.02, W = 0.02
scene = display(x=0,y=0,width=800,height=400,
center=(0.1,H/2,0.0),range=(0.1,0.1,0.1));
ground = box(pos=(0.1,-0.001,0.0),size=(0.2,0.002,d));
block = box(pos=(x,H/2,W/2),size=(L,H,W),color=color.blue);
spring = helix(pos=(0,H/2,W/2),axis=(x-L/2,0,0),radius=H/4);
while 1:
rate(100);
a = -k/m*(x-d);
v = v + a*dt;
x = x + v*dt;
block.x = x;
spring.axis = (x - L/2,0.0,0.0);
if scene.mouse.clicked:
mc = scene.mouse.getclick();
x = mc.pos.x;
print ’x0 = ’,x,’, v0 = ’,v
The main program structure is the same as before, but we are now not storing
the values of the positions and velocities of the block—we are only visualizing their
instantaneous values. The first part consists of the commands necessary to set up
the window, the ground, the block and the spring. In the loop we use the function
rate(100) to ensure that this loop can only run 100 times a second. We also read
the mouse position to set new values of the position—which corresponds to setting
new initial values. You should try the program—see if you can get the block to stand
almost completely still. You can see how the program looks on screen in Fig. 5.18.
Simplified model—Analytical solution: (You may skip this section without loss of
continuity—solving differential equations often involves tricks that require experi-
ence, often are non-intuitive and not simple to follow.)
For this particular problem, we can also find the exact solution, which means
finding a function y(t) that satisfies (5.62) and the initial conditions. The problem is
simplified by rewriting the equation using the equilibrium position yeq = −mg/k
5.7 Force Model: Spring Force 117
Fig. 5.18 Visualization of the system using VPython
a = −g − (k/m) y = − (k/m) (y − yeq
) , (5.64)
where we introduce a new variable, u = y − yeq . Since yeq is a constant, this does
not change the second derivative with respect to time:
d2u
dt2 = d2 y
dt2 = − (k/m) u , (5.65)
where the initial conditions now are u(0) = y(0)−yeq = −yeq and du/dt (0) = v(0).
Finding an analytical solution means finding a function y(t) that satisfies (5.65)
and the initial conditions. If we have found one such function, we can be sure this is
the solution, because there is a uniqueness theorem in the mathematics of ordinary
differential equations.
What functions become minus themselves after being derived twice? You may
know (if you have already learned this trick), that this is true for the trigonometric
functions sin and cos. The general solution to (5.65) is:
u(t) = A cos(ωt) + B sin(ωt) . (5.66)
If we insert (5.66) in (5.65) we find that ω = √k/m. The two prefactors A and B
must be determined from the initial conditions:
u(0) = A cos(0) = A = −yeq = mg/k , (5.67)
and
du/dt (0) = Bω cos(0) = 0 ⇒ B = 0 (5.68)
So the complete solution is
118 5 Forces in One Dimension
y(t) = u(t) + yeq = (mg/k) cos ωt − (mg/k) . (5.69)
(Please do not be discouraged if you did not understand how we found the solution
in this case. You will solve this equation many times in your career, and each time
you will learn to know it better. Eventually, it will become a natural part of your
knowledge base.)
Simplified model—Symbolic solution: You can solve (5.62) using the symbolic
package in Python. First, you need to define all the relavant variables in the problem,
where we introduce q = k/m for simplicity:
>> from sympy import *
>> y = Function(’y’)
>> from sympy.abc import t
>> from sympy.abc import g
>> from sympy.abc import q
Then, we solve the differential equation, which includes the second derivative of y(t),
which is written as Derivative(y(t),t,2). In addition, we need to provide
the initial conditions at both y(0) = y0 and dy/dt (0) = 0. To solve the equation, we
need to rewrite it so that the right hand side consists of a zero:
d2 y
dt2 = −g − q y ⇒ d2 y
dt2 + g + q y = 0 . (5.70)
We can then use dsolve to find the analytical solution:
>> dsolve(Derivative(y(t),t,2)+g+q*y(t),y(t))
y(t) == -g/q + (C1*sin(t*Abs((re(q)**2 + im(q)**2)**(1/4)*....
Ooops! This is the correct result, but it is in a form which you may not recognize,
unless you have some experience with complex numbers. The key lies in the sign of
q. In our case, q is a positive number, but we have not told the symbolic solver this.
We can redefine q and try again:
>> q = Symbol(’q’, real=True, positive=True)
>> dsolve(Derivative(y(t),t,2)+g+q*y(t),y(t))
y(t) == C1*sin(sqrt(q)*t) + C2*cos(sqrt(q)*t) - g/q
This result was much simpler to interpret! This is indeed the answer we found pre-
viously, we only need to substitute the correct initial conditions, just like we did
above.
Simplified model—Analysis: The solution we have found so far show an everlasting,
oscillating motion:
y(t) = (mg/k) cos (ωt) − (mg/k) . (5.71)
The block oscillates up and down with a period T = 2π/ω. However, this is not what
we would expect in a realistic situation, where we expect the motion to be damped
and that the block eventually comes to rest. We can study one way this may happen
by introducing air resistance.
5.7 Force Model: Spring Force 119
Full model—Numerical solution: Now, we assume that the block also is affected
by a non-negligible air resistance force, F D described by an advanced model for
air resistance: At large velocities the air resistance force is described by a quadratic
law with drag coefficient D = 0.15 m−1 , and at low velocities it is described by a
viscous drag force with drag constant k v. We assume that the transition occurs at
vt = 0.01 m/s:
F D (v) =
{ −Dv(t)|v(t)| , v > vt
−k v v(t) , v < vt (5.72)
A continuous force requires the two behaviors to be the same at v = vt , that is:
− Dv2
t = −k v vt ⇒ k v = Dvt . (5.73)
(You are not yet expected to come up with a law like this, but you should be able to
solve problems if you are given such a law).
This gives us a force model for F D and we can find the motion of the block using a
numerical scheme such as Euler-Cromer, as implemented in the following program.
Notice the use of the if-statement in order to test if the ball is experiencing the
high-velocity or the low-velocity air resistance force:
from pylab import *
# Initialize
m = 1.0 # kg
k = 100.0 # N/m
v0 = 0.0 # in m/s
time = 15.0 #
s g = 9.8 # m/sˆ2
D = 2.5 # mˆ-1
vt = 0.2 # m/s
kv = D*vt
# Numerical setup
dt = 0.0001 # s
n = int(round(time/dt))
t = zeros(n,float)
y = zeros(n,float)
v = zeros(n,float)
# Initial values
y[0] = 0.0
v[0] = v0
# Simulation loop
for i in range(n-1):
if (v[i]<vt)
FD = -kv*v[i]
elseFD = -D*v[i]*abs(v[i])
F = -k*y[i] - m*g + FD
a = F/m
v[i+1] = v[i] + a*dt
y[i+1] = y[i] + v[i+1]*dt
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
The resulting behavior is shown in Fig. 5.19. The dashed line shows the equilibrium
solution, y = yeq , and the numerical solution does indeed converge towards this.
The dotted line shows the solution without air resistance, which demonstrates that
the air resistance does not affect the oscillation period significantly.

5.8 Newton’s First Law
What happens if the net external force on a body is zero? Applying Newton’s second
law, we find:
Fnet = 0 = ma ⇒ a = dv
dt = 0 . (5.74)
The acceleration is zero, which means that the velocity of the object is constant. This
is often referred to as Newton’s first law:
Newton’s first law: An object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in
that state unless an external force changes its state of motion.
Why do we need a separate law for this? Is it not simply a special case of Newton’s
second law? Yes, Newton’s first law can be deduced from the second law as we have
illustrated. However, the first law is often used for a different purpose: Newton’s
First Law tells us about the limit of applicability of Newton’s Second law. Newton’s
Second law can only be used in reference systems where the First law is obeyed. But
is not the First law always valid? No! The First law is only valid in reference systems
that are not accelerated. If you observe the motion of a ball from an accelerating
car, the ball will appear to accelerate even if there are no forces acting on it. We call
systems that are not accelerating inertial systems, and Newton’s first law is often
called the law of inertia. Newton’s first and second laws of motion are only valid in
inertial systems. We will discuss references systems and inertial systems in detail
when we discuss motion in two and three dimensions in Chap. 6.
A system is an inertial system if it is not accelerated—that is, the reference system
must not be accelerating linearly or rotating. Unfortunately, this means that most
systems we know are not really inertial systems. For example, the surface of the
Earth is clearly not an inertial system, because the Earth is rotating. The Earth is also
5.8 Newton’s First Law 121
not an inertial system, because it is moving in a curved path around the Sun. However,
even if the surface of the Earth is not strictly an inertial system, it may be considered
to be approximately an inertial system for many laboratory-size experiments.
5.9 Newton’s Third Law
So far, we have studied the motion of a single object by considering the interactions
between the object (the system) and the environment (everything else). But most
problems we deal with include an interplay between several objects. How can we
address such systems?
We already started to address systems with several components when we addressed
forces between a system and its environment. When you press your finger toward
the table, you experience a force, and the table experiences a force. How are these
forces related?
First, we realize that they act on different objects. There is a force from the finger
on the table, and a force from the table on the finger. If the finger is the system, there
is a contact force on the finger from the table, which is in the environment. On the
other hand, if the table is the system, there is a contact force on the table from the
finger, which is the environment in this case.
Could we get around this by introducing a more precise description of the inter-
action between the table and the finger? We argued that the top of the table is really
not flat but rather rough on a microscopic scale—its surface consists of microscopic
bumps. When I press my finger on the table, I press onto these small bumps, so that
the bumps are deformed, and the bumps push down on the table. However, when my
finger pushes toward the bumps, there is still a force from the finger on the bumps
and a force from the bumps on my finger. Similarly, the bumps press down on the
rest of the table, and the rest of the table pushes up on the bumps.
We realize that all forces, all interactions between objects, come in pairs. If there
is a force from object A on object B, there is also a force from object B on object A.
This fundamental principle of interactions is called Newton’s third law. We do not
know of any force that do not obey this law: All forces appear in pairs. Newton’s
third law is usually formulated as:
Newton’s third law of motion: For every action there is an equal and opposite
reaction.
This is a classical formulation of Newton’s third law. The words “action” and “reac-
tion” here means force and counter-force. If you push with your finger (F) on the table
(T), there is a force, an action, Ffrom F on T , from the finger on the table. Typically we
write this by subindicies:
122 5 Forces in One Dimension
Ffrom F on T , (5.75)
for the force from F on T.
Newton’s third law then states that there is an equal and oppositely directed force
from the table on the finger. That is:
Ffrom T on F = −Ffrom F on T , (5.76)
It is important to realize that the two forces in the force-pair act on different objects.
Application of Newton’s Third Law
Let us introduce and apply Newton’s third law through a simple example. We address
a two crates lying on top of each other on the ground, as illustrated in Fig. 5.20a. The
system consists of three bodies: the top crate (A), the bottom crate (B), and the ground
(E). The ground is really the whole Earth, and we therefore use the symbol (E). We
use the standard procedure to establish the free-body diagram for the compound
system.

Drawing a free-body diagram for a compound system:
Follow these steps to find and identify all the forces acting on an each object,
and then to draw the free-body diagram for each of the objects the system.
• Draw each object as separate systems.
• Find all forces on all objects, and draw them as vectors.
• Express the forces as FA on B .
• Identify action-reaction pairs.
• Check that every force has a unique reaction, and that they act on different
objects. Draw in the axes of the coordinate system.
1. Draw all objects as separate systems. This is done in Fig. 5.20b. We draw the
systems apart, so that we have room to fill in more details such as forces and
coordinate systems for the various systems.
2. Find all forces on all objects, and draw them as vectors. This is done in
Fig. 5.20c. For each object, we find where it is in contact with other objects,
or with the environment, and draw in the contact forces. Finally, we add the
long-range forces. Here, the only long-range force is gravity. Note that gravity
acts between all the objects, but we have only included the gravitational forces
between the Earth and each of the two crates, since the gravitational force between
the two crates are negligible.
3. Express the forces as Ffrom A on B . For each of the forces we find what object it is
acting on, and in what object the force has it origin. This is shown in Fig. 5.20d.
4. Identify action-reaction pairs. We draw a dotted line between each action-
reaction pair. All force in our figure should have an origin either in one of the
other objects, or in the environment. For clarity, we have placed the gravitational
force from the crate on the Earth, in a point close to the surface of the Earth. In
reality, these forces act in the center of the Earth. We have illustrated this process
in Fig. 5.20e
5. Check that every force has a unique reaction, and that they act on different
objects. Draw in the axes of the coordinate system.
The result of this analysis is a free-body diagram for each of the objects. The pro-
posed method is elaborate. You may argue that it is too elaborate. As you become
experienced, you no longer need to be this rigorous in your approach. An expert
would draw the free-body diagram directly, but would still recognize action-reaction
pairs in the drawing, even though he will probably not mark them.
When you become more experienced in recognizing action-reaction pairs, you
may also exclude The Earth from the drawing in Fig. 5.20e. Instead, you will draw
two objects, and consider everything outside the two objects to be the environment.
You can do this, because you are typically not interested in the motion of the Earth,
but only the motion and in the forces on the two crates. In this case, you will have
two types of forces in your drawing of one of the objects: either a force has its
origin in one of the other objects, in this case your free-body diagrams include the
124 5 Forces in One Dimension
action-reaction pair, or a force has its origin in the environment. This is illustrated in
Fig. 5.20f. Here, the two gravitational forces on the two crates, and the normal force
on the lower crate, all have their origin in the environment, and their reactions are
therefore not included in the figure.
One of the most common mistakes when applying Newton’s third law is to assign
an incorrect action-reaction pair. For example, it is common to assign the normal
force Ffrom B on A to be the reaction force to Gfrom E on A in Fig. 5.20d. Such an error
can be spotted in two ways: First, the action-reaction pair in this case acts on the
same object. They must always act on different objects according to Newton’s third
law. Second, the two forces are due to quite different mechanisms and contacts. For
contact forces, the action and reaction forces act in the same point. For long-range
forces, the action-reaction pair is due to the same type of interaction between the
two objects. In Fig. 5.20d the reaction force to the gravity from the Earth on crate A
must therefore also be a gravitational force and also between the same two objects.
Structured Approach to Compound Problems
With the addition of Newton’s third law, we now have sufficient tools to address the
forces between objects in problems with several moving components. We call such
systems compound systems. Solving problems with several components are not more
complicated than solving problems with just a single object—we simply apply the
structured problem-solving approach to each of the objects.
5.9.1 Example: Weight in an Elevator
In this example you learn to analyze problems with several bodies, using Newton’s
third law to relate force pairs, and apply Newton’s second law to find the motion of
each body in the system.
Problem: A person of mass m is standing in an elevator of mass M. The person is
standing on spring-weight with negligible mass and spring constant k. Find the force
shown by the weight and the force in the wire if both the elevator and the person is
moving with a constant acceleration a. Discuss what really happens as the elevator
starts moving from rest.
Our plan is to find the forces acting on each object and use Newton’s second
law to find the acceleration of each object. If all objects are moving with the same
acceleration, we can use this to find the forces between the object. In the second part
the objects do not necessarily have the same acceleration, and we need to introduce
force models for the internal forces to relate the positions.
Sketch and identify: In this problem we are studying the motion of the elevator
(E), the weight (W), and person (P) as illustrated in Fig. 5.21, described by the
corresponding positions, x E (t), x W (t), and x P (t).

Model: We find the forces acting on each object separately in three free-body dia-
grams (see Fig. 5.21). The elevator is affected by the external force T from the wire,
the contact force NW on E from the weight, gravity, G E = m E g. The weight is affected
by the contact force NE on W from the elevator and the contact force NP on W from
the person. The gravitational force is negligible, G W = 0. The person is affected by
the contact force NW on P from the weight and by gravity, G P = m P g. We notice
that the contact forces NE on W and NW on E are action-reaction pairs, and similarly
for NP on W and NE on W . We apply Newton’s second law in the vertical direction for
each object:
Elevator: ∑
j
F j,E = T − NW on E − G E = m E a E . (5.77)
Weight: ∑
j
F j,W = NE on W − NP on W = m W
︸︷︷︸
=0
a W = 0 . (5.78)
Person: ∑
j
F j,P = NW on P − G P = m P a P . (5.79)
Notice that the directions of the forces are included in the choice of signs. This means
that NW on P is the magnitude of this contact force. Newton’s third law therefore
gives that NW on P = NP on W = N P , where we have written N P for simplicity, and
similarly NW on E = NE on W = N E .
Simplified model—No motion: First, let us address the case where the elevator is
not moving. In this case all the accelerations are zero, and we find from (5.79) that
NW on P − G P = m P a P = 0 ⇒ N P = G P . (5.80)
126 5 Forces in One Dimension
Since what we read from the weight is the normal force applied to the weight, this
means that we can read the gravitational force on the person from the weight, which
is what we call the weight of the person!
The force, T , from the wire can be found from (5.77):
T − NW on E − G E = m E a E = 0 , (5.81)
which gives
T = N E + G E , (5.82)
where (5.78) always gives N E = N P , which we combine with N P = G P , getting:
T = N E + G E = G E + G P = (m E + m P ) g . (5.83)
When the system is at rest, the force from the wire is equal to the sum of the gravi-
tational forces.
Simplified model—No relative motion: Second, we assume that the elevator, the
weight, and the person do not move relative to each other. They will therefore have
the same acceleration, a E = a W = a P = a. In this case, the weight still displays the
contact force N P , but this force is now given by (5.79), which gives:
N P = G P + m P a P = m P g + m P a = m P (a + g) . (5.84)
So the number you read on the weight is larger if the elevator is accelerating upward.
Full model—Force models: Finally, what happens if we open for the possibility that
the objects move relative to each other? As the elevator starts to move, the weight
starts to compress, increasing the force on the person, until the person starts moving,
changing the compression in the spring in the weight, and so on. We must “Solve”
to find the motion of each of the objects based on force models for the interactions.
We can still use (5.77), since the mass of the weight is negligible, which means that
N E = N P = N , and the forces acting on each end of the spring are the same!
How do we model the contact force N ? It depends on the compression of the
spring inside the weight. Let us describe the position of each side of the weight. If
we describe the motion of the person by the position of her feet, they are in contact
with the top of the weight, and the position of the top of the weight is therefore x P (t).
Similarly, we can describe the position of the elevator by the position of the point
where the weight is in contact with the elevator, so that the bottom of the weight is
at x E (t). The change in the extension of the spring inside the weight is therefore
ΔL = L − L0 = x P − x E − L0 , (5.85)
where L0 is the equilibrium distance between the top and bottom of the weight. The
weight is compressed by the contact force, N , which is given as a spring force:
5.9 Newton’s Third Law 127
N = ±kΔL (5.86)
where we must choose the sign to ensure that a compressive force must be applied to
compress the spring. The normal force must be positive if the spring is compressed.
For compression ΔL < 0. The sign must therefore be negative to ensure a positive
contact force:
N = −kΔL = −k (x P − x E − L0) , (5.87)
Notice that the contact force cannot be negative, since the person is not glued to the
weight. A weight can push, but not pull, on a person standing on it.
Full model—Newton’s second law: Finally, we have a force model for the contact
forces, and we can use Newton’s second law to find equations for the positions of
the person and the elevator. Newton’s second law for the elevator from (5.77) gives:
T − N − G E = m E a E , (5.88)
and similarly Newton’s second law for the person from (5.79) gives:
N − G P = m P a P , (5.89)
where N from (5.87) is a function of both x E and x P .
We can rewrite these equations as:
a E = d2 x E
dt2 = 1
m E
(T + k (x P − x E − L0) − m E g) , (5.90)
a P = d2 x P
dt2 = 1
m P
(−k (x P − x E − L0) − m P g) . (5.91)
While these differential equations may seem daunting, they are not that difficult
to solve analytically (but we will not do that here), and they are simple to solve
numerically (which we will do here).
Full model—Initial conditions: What are the initial conditions? We know that the
person and elevator are starting from rest. Then an additional force F was added
to the elevator. Since they are starting from rest, we know that the initial velocities
are zero: v E (t0) = 0 m/s and v P (t0) = 0 m/s. What about the initial positions? We
know that initially the person is standing on the weight. The weight must therefore
be compressed. We find the compression from Newton’s second law for the person,
in the case where the acceleration is zero:
a P (t0) = −k (x P (t0) − x E (t0) − L0) − m P g = 0 , (5.92)
128 5 Forces in One Dimension
which gives
x P (t0) = x E (t0) + L0 − m P g
k , (5.93)
where we are free to choose the coordinate system so that x E (t0) = 0 m.
Notice that the elevator was started by adding a force F to the tension T already
in the wire when the system is at rest. We find the initial value for T from Newton’s
second law for the elevator in the case where the acceleration is zero:
a E (t0) = T + k (x P − x E − L0) − m E g = 0 , (5.94)
where (5.92) gives k (x P − x E − L0) = m P g, which inserted in (5.94) gives:
T = m E g + m P g = (m E + m P )g . (5.95)
This is not surprising: At rest, the force T from the wire must balance the total
gravitational force on the elevator with the person, T = G P + G E , just as we found
above. And the result would be the same if we assumed the elevator, weight, and
person to be a single object with mass M = m E + m P .
Full model—Numerical solution: While this problem can be solved analytically,
the numerical solution and discussion is simpler, and provides the most essential
insights into the process. We therefore apply Euler-Cromer’s method to find the
positions and velocities of the person and the elevator starting from t = t0 = 0.0 s.
The method is implemented in the following program:
from numpy import *
The positions x E and x P are compared with the positions found using the acceleration
of the whole system found previously:
a = T − (m E + m P )g
m E + m P
. (5.96)
The resulting behavior is shown in Fig. 5.22. We see that the position of the person
on the weight oscillates around the stationary solution. The position of the elevator
also oscillates, but the oscillations are much smaller and are therefore not visible on
this plot.
Analysis: What we read off the weight is the spring force, which is:
N = −k (x P − x E − L0) (5.97)
The spring force is plotted as a function of time in Fig. 5.23. The spring force, which is
the force read off the weight, oscillates around the expected value, N = m P (g +a) =
823.2 N, indicated by the straight line in the plot.

Final comment: Here, we have found an alternative behavior of the weight-spring
system: The weight is oscillating! Such a behavior is to be expected in a real system,
but there will also be additional forces that will tend to reduce the oscillations, so
that after a few oscillations, the weight will stop at the expected value, F = 823.2 N
Summary
Newton’s second law:
• Newton’s second law relates the acceleration of an object to the net forces acting
on it: ∑
j F j = ma, where the sum is over all forces acting on the object, and m
is the inertial mass.
• All forces acting on a system has a source in the environment.
• Forces can be contact forces acting on the boundary between the system and the
environment.
• Forces can be long range forces from an object in the environment.
• Forces are drawn as vectors starting at the point where the force is acting, pointing
in the direction of the force, and with a length indicating the length of the force.
• The force may be a given quantity, F.
130 5 Forces in One Dimension
• The gravitational force acts between all objects. On the surface of the Earth the
gravitational force on an object is W = −mg j, where j is a unit vector pointing
upward, g is the acceleration of gravity, and m is the gravitational mass. The
gravitational mass is equal to the inertial mass.
• The contact force from a fluid on a moving object depends on the velocity of
the object relative to the fluid. The simplest force model is the viscous force,
D = −k vv, where the constant k v depends on the viscosity of the fluid and the size
of the object.
• The contact force from a solid depends on the distance between the object and the
solid. The simplest force model is the spring force, F = −kΔL i. Where ΔL is the
elongation, and k is the spring constant which gives the stiffness of the contact.
The spring model is one of the most fundamental force models because it is the
first order Taylor expansion of any position-dependent force.
Problem-solving approach:
• We identify the object and its initial conditions.
• We model the behavior by find the forces acting on the object, introducing force
models for all the forces, and applying Newton’s second law to find an equation
for the acceleration of the object.
• We solve the problem by finding the position and velocity from the acceleration
and the initial conditions using numerical or analytical techniques.
• We analyze the solution to validate it, and use the solution to answer the original
question posed.

Now, let us modify the experiment. We now drop two spheres of different diameter,
d1 and d2 , but the spheres are solid and made of the same materials, for example
steel. They will therefore have different masses, m1 and m2 . Still, air resistance for
both spheres are described using a quadratic law, but the coefficient D depends on
cross-sectional area of the sphere, and therefore on the diameter: D = C0d2 , where
C0 is a constant.

Projects
5.29 Modeling a 100 m race. In this project we will develop an advanced model
for the motion of a sprinter during a 100 m race. We will build the model gradually,
adding complications one at a time to develop a realistic model for the race.
(a) A sprinter is accelerating along the track. Draw a free-body diagram of the sprinter,
including only horizontal forces. Try to make the length of the vectors correspond
to the relative magnitudes of the forces.
Let us assume that the sprinter is accelerated by a constant horizontal driving
force, F = 400 N, from the ground all the way from the start to the 100 m line
(averaged over a few steps). The mass of the sprinter is m = 80 kg.
(b) Find the position, x(t), of the sprinter as a function of time.
(c) Show that the sprinter uses t = 6.3 s to reach the 100 m line.
This is a bit fast compared with real races. However, real sprinters are limited by
air resistance. Let us introduce a model for air resistance by assuming that the air
resistance force is described by a square law:
D = (1/2)ρC D A(v − w)2 (5.98)
where ρ is the density of air, A is the cross-sectional area of the runner, C D is the
drag coefficient, v is the velocity of the runner, and w is the velocity of the air. At
sea level ρ = 1.293 kg/m 3 , and for the runner we can assume A = 0.45 m 2 , and
C D = 1.2. You can initially assume that there is no wind: w = 0 m/s.
Assume that the runner is only affected by the constant driving force, F, and the
air resistance force, D.
(d) Find an expression for the acceleration of the runner.
(e) Use Euler’s method to find the velocity, v(t), and position, x(t) as a function of
time for the runner. The runner starts from rest at the time t = 0s. Plot the position,
velocity and acceleration of the runner as a function of time. How did you decide
on the time-step Δt? (Your answer should include the program used to solve the
problem and the resulting plots).
(f) Use the results to find the race time for the 100 m race.
136 5 Forces in One Dimension
(g) Show that the (theoretical) maximum velocity of a runner driven by these forces is:
v T = √2F/ (ρ C D A) . (5.99)
The runner may have to run more than 100 m to reach this velocity. (We often call this
maximum velocity the terminal velocity—“terminal” because the velocity increases
until it reaches the terminal velocity, where the acceleration becomes zero). Find the
numerical value of the terminal velocity for the runner. Do you think this is realistic?
So far the model only includes a constant driving force and air resistance. This is
clearly a too simplified model to be realistic. Let us make the model more realistic
by adding a few features.
First, there is a physiological limit to how fast you can run. The driving force
from the runner should therefore decrease with velocity, so that there is a maximum
velocity at which the acceleration is zero even without air resistance. While we do not
know the detailed physiological mechanisms for this effect, we can make a simplified
force model to implement the effect by introducing a driving force, F D , with two
terms: a constant term, F, and a term that decreases with increasing velocity, FV :
FV = − f V v, so that the driving force is:
F D = F + FV = F − f V v . (5.100)
Reasonable values for the parameters are F = 400 N, and f v = 25.8 sN/m. (These
values are chosen to make the maximum velocity reasonable—they are not based on
a physiological consideration).
(h) If you assume that the runner is subject only to these two driving forces, what is
his maximum velocity? (You can ignore the drag term, D, in this calculation).
In addition, during the first few seconds the runner is crouched and accelerating
rapidly. In this phase, his cross-sectional area is smaller because he is crouched, and
the driving force exerted by the runner is larger than later. Let us also introduce these
aspects into our model.
First, let us assume that the crouched phase lasts approximately for a time, tc. We
do not expect this phase to end abruptly at a specific time. Instead, we expect the
driving force to decrease gradually (and the cross-sectional area to increase gradually)
as the runner is going from a crouched to an upright running position. A common
way to approximate such a change is through an exponential function that depends
on the time and the characteristic time, tc. For example, by introducing an initial
driving force, FC :
FC = f c exp(−(t/t c)2) . (5.101)
When t = 0, the force is equal to f c, but as time increases, the force decreases
rapidly. When the time has reached t c, the force has dropped to 1/e  0.37 of the
value at t = 0, and after a time 4t c this contribution to the driving force has dropped
to less than 2 % of its initial value.
Notice that we do not have any experimental or theoretical reason to use this
particular form for the time dependence. We have simply chosen a convenient form
5.9 Newton’s Third Law 137
as a first approximation, and then we use this form and try to get reasonable results
with it. A better approach would be to have experimental data on how the force varied
during the first few seconds, but unfortunately we do not know this. Making rough
estimates that you can subsequently improve by better measurements, calculations,
or theory will be an important part of how you apply physics in practice.
The total driving force is then:
F D = F + f c exp(−(t/t c)2) − f v v . (5.102)
where reasonable values for the parameters are f c = 488 N and t c = 0.67 s. (These
values are chosen so that the total race-time becomes reasonable).
In addition, we need to modify the air resistance force because the runner is
crouched in the initial phase, so that the cross-sectional area is reduced. We therefore
need to replace the cross-sectional area A in the expression for D with a time-
dependent expression, A(t), with the properties that: (1) when time is zero, the
area should be reduced to 75 % of the area during upright running (again, we guess
reasonable values); and (2) after a time much larger than tc, the runner is upright,
and the cross-sectional area should be A. Again, we introduce a modification to the
area that depends on the exponential factor used above:
A(t) = A − 0.25A exp(−(t/t c)2) = A
(
1 − 0.25 exp(−(t/t c)2)
)
. (5.103)
The air resistance force therefore becomes:
D = 1
2 A(t)ρC D (v − w)2 = 1
2 A
(
1 − 0.25e−(t/t c )2 )
ρC D (v − w)2 (5.104)
The total force on the runner is:
Fnet = F + FC − FV − D = F + f c e−(t/t c )2
− f v v − D , (5.105)
where F = 400 N is a constant driving force, and the other terms have been addressed
above.
(i) Modify your numerical method to include these new forces. Find and plot x(t),
v(t), and a(t) for the motion.
(j) How fast does he run 100 m?
(k) Compare the magnitudes of the various forces acting on the runner by plotting
F (which is constant), FC , FV and D as a function of time for a 100 m race. Discuss
how important the various effects are.
(l) Use the model to test how the resulting time on 100 m would change if the runner
had a hind wind with a wind speed of w = 1 m/s. What if he was running into a wind
with a wind speed of w = 1 m/s?

a person bungee jumping. The bungee cord acts as an ideal spring with a spring

constant k when it is stretched, but it has no strength when pushed together. The
cord’s equilibrium length is d. There is also a form of dampening in the cord, which
we will model as a force which is dependent on the speed of the cord’s deformation.
When the cord is stretched a length x, and is being stretched with the instantaneous
speed v, the force from the spring is given as
F(x, v) =
{ −k(x − d) − cv v when x > d
0 when x ≤ d
where cv is a constant that describes the dampening in the cord, and k is the spring
constant.
We set x = 0 to be where the bungee cord is attached and let the positive direction
of the x-axis point downwards. A person with a mass m places the cord around the
waist and jumps from the point where it is attached. The initial velocity is v0 = 0.
You can neglect air resistance and assume that the bungee cord is massless. The
motion is solely vertical. The acceleration of gravity is g.
(a) Draw a free-body diagram of the person when the bungee cord is taut. Name all
the forces.
(b) At what height is the person hanging when the motion has stopped?
(c) Write a numerical algorithm that finds the persons position and velocity at the
time t + Δt given the persons position and velocity at a time t. And implement this
algorithm in a program that finds the motion of a person bungee jumping.
(d) Use your program to plot the height as a function of time, x(t), for a person of
mass m = 70 kg jumping with a bungee cord of equilibrium length d = 20 m and
spring constant k = 150 N/m, for T = 60 s with a timestep of dt = 0.01 s. The
acceleration of gravity is g = 9.8 m/s 2 . What is a reasonable choice for cv? Explain
your choice.
(e) Is the system conservative during the whole motion, parts of the motion, or not
at all? Explain.
(f) How would our model be different if we included air resistance?
Chapter 6
Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
You have now learned to use Newton’s second law. This is the main tool you need to
solve problems in mechanics. However, so far, we have only addressed motion and
forces in one dimension. Fortunately, the description of motion and Newton’s laws do
not change when we go to higher dimensions. We can continue to apply the structured
problem-solving approach in exactly the same way as we did before. But in order to
address motion in two- and three dimensions, we need to extend our mathematical
and numerical methods to address two- and three-dimensional motion. This will be
done in two parts: In this chapter we introduce general two- and three-dimensional
motion. Later we will introduce constrained motion—motion constrained to occur
along a specific path in the same way a rollercoaster cart is constrained to follow the
rollercoaster track, or in the way a part of a rotating body is following the rotation
of the body.
6.1 Vectors
The use of vectors to describe positions in two- and three-dimensional systems is
essential in order to describe general motion. If you are familiar with the use of
vectors you can safely jump to the next section.
Scalars and Vectors
A scalar is a single number (with notation), such as a length, a mass, or a temperature.
In order to describe physical quantities such as a displacement or a force, we need to
describe both a magnitude and a direction: A displacement is described by a distance
and a direction; A force is described by the magnitude of the force and the direction
it acts in.

dot product
A vector is a quantity with both direction and length. A vector can have physical
units.
We indicate that a quantity is a vector by drawing a small arrow above it: a. 1 It will be
important for you to use a notation that clearly separates vector and scalar quantities.
Because one of the most common mistakes made by students is to mix up vectors
and scalars in their calculations, with dire results, we strongly urge you to use the
arrow notation for vectors and to stick with it.
Vector Addition
Vector addition is intuitive for the addition of displacements (see Fig. 6.1b): If you
first move along the vector a from A to B, and then along the vector b from B to C,
the net displacement is the vector:
c = a + b , (6.1)
from point A to C.
This geometric definition of vector addition is general, and we use it also for vec-
tors that are not displacements: We find the sum of two vectors a and b geometrically
by placing the tail of vector b at the tip of vector a. The sum is called the resultant
vector.
1 Our definition of a vector is rather limited compared to the more general definition of vector spaces
you may be used to in mathematics. It means we usually limit ourselves to vectors in one, two, and
three Cartesian dimensions. Usually, we illustrate a vector by an arrow, as shown in Fig. 6.1a. The
length of the arrow indicates the magnitude, and the direction shows the direction of the vector.
Notice that it does not matter where we start drawing a vector. The vector a in Fig. 6.1 is the same
even if it is drawn in position A, B, or C, but the vector b in position D is different, because it has
a different direction than a, and the vector c in position E is different from both a and b since it
has a different magnitude. Remember: The only thing that matters for a vector is its magnitude and
direction—not where it starts.
6.1 Vectors 141
From this definition, we realize that vector addition is commutative, the order of
addition is arbitrary, and associative:
a + b = b + a , (commutative law) (6.2)
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c , (associative law) (6.3)
Scalar Multiplication
We can rescale the length of a vector by multiplying it with a scalar:
b = 2a . (6.4)
Vector b is twice as long as vector a, but still pointing in the same direction. By
multiplying a vector with a scalar we change the magnitude, but not the direction of
the vector.
If we multiply a vector by 0, we get a vector of zero length, called the zero vector:
0a = 0 . (6.5)
If we multiply a vector by a negative number, we change the direction of the vector
to point in the opposite direction. For example, if we multiply with a vector with
−1, we get the negative vector—a vector of the same length, but which points in the
opposite direction.
Vector Components
A coordinate system is a grid you choose to describe the world in numbers. You are
free to choose any coordinate system you like: You may choose where to place the
origin and how to orient the axis. When you have decided on this, we use the coordi-
nate system to describe a vector by decomposing the vector in the given coordinate
system.
Here, we use Cartesian coordinate systems, where the axes are orthogonal to each
other. We describe the coordinate system by the position of the origin, O, and by
unit vectors pointing along each axis: the x-, y-, and z-axis. The unit vectors are of
unit length, of length 1, and do not have any unit. The unit vectors are orthogonal,
they form 90◦ angles with each other, as illustrated in Fig. 6.1c. It is common to use
the symbol i, j, and k for the unit vectors along the x, y, and z-axis respectively.
142 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
Any vector can be uniquely decomposed into a set of component vectors along
each of the axes:
A = Ax + Ay , (6.6)
as illustrated in Fig. 6.1c, where each of the component vectors can be written in
terms of the unit vector along the axis:
Ax = A x i , Ay = A y j . (6.7)
Here, the units of the vectors are in the scalar numbers A x and A y .
If you know the magnitude and direction of a vector, you can find the component
of the vector from trigonometrical considerations. For example, the vector A shown
in Fig. 6.1c, may be decomposed into its x- and y-components by:
A = A x i + A y j = |A| cos φ i + |A| sin φ j . (6.8)
We may write a vector by using the unit vectors or by writing the vector directly in
coordinate form:
A = A x i + A y j + A z k = (A x , A y , A z
) . (6.9)
The Magnitude of a Vector Using Components
If the coordinate system is orthogonal, then all the axis are orthogonal to each other,
and we can use Pythagoras’ theorem to relate the magnitude to the vector to the
components:
|A| =
√
A2
x + A2
y + A2
z . (6.10)
Addition, Subtraction and Scalar Multiplication Using Components
A particular advantage of the component form is that addition, subtraction, and scalar
multiplications can be done for each component independently.

cA = c (A x i + A y j) = c A x i + c A y j . (6.12)
6.1 Vectors 143
The Dot Product
The dot product between two vectors A and B is defined as:
A · B = |A||B| cos α , (6.13)
where α is the angle between the two vectors, as illustrated in Fig. 6.1d.
The dot product is linear:
(A + B) · C = A · C + B · C , (6.14)
and commutative:
A · B = B · A . (6.15)
The dot product depends on the angle α, as illustrated in Fig. 6.1d. When two vectors
are parallel and point in the same direction, the dot product is equal to the product of
the magnitudes. A particular useful property of the dot product is that the dot product
of two orthogonal vectors is zero. As a result the dot product is simple on component
form
A · B = (A x i + A y j) · (B x i + B y j)
= A x B x i · i︸︷︷︸

+A y B x j · i
︸︷︷︸
=0
+A y B y j · j
︸︷︷︸
=1
= A x B x + A y B y .
(6.16)
The value of the dot product is independent of the unit vectors used to decompose
the vectors. We say that the dot product is invariant under a change of coordinate
system.
What makes the dot product so useful, is that it can be used to decompose a vector
onto a given set of unit vector—it can be used to find the components of a vector in
any given coordinate system. A vector A can be written in component form as:
A = A x i + A y j + A z k . (6.17)
How can we determine the components A x , A y , and A z ? We find them by using to dot
product, and remembering that the unit vectors are orthogonal. We find component
A x from:
A · i = A x i · i︸︷︷︸
=1
+A y j · i
︸︷︷︸
=0
+A z k · i︸︷︷︸
=0
= A x , (6.18)
and similarly for the other components:
144 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
The component of a vector A can be found by dot-multiplication with the unit
vectors i, j, and k:
A x = A · i , A y = A · j , A z = A · k , (6.19)
so that
A = (A · i) i + (A · j) j + (A · k) k . (6.20)
Numerical Representation of Vectors
In Python a vector is represented by its component form. The vector a:
a = 1 i + 2 j = (1, 2, 0) , (6.21)
is generated by the following command:
a = array([1,2,0]);
Addition and Subtraction
All the ordinary mathematical operations can be applied to vectors just as you would
apply them to scalars. For example, vector addition is achieved by:
b = array([2,-4,0])
c = a + b
print(c)
[ 3 -2 0]
You can decide if you want to use a vector in two- or three dimensions. For example,
you could instead have defined the vector a as:
a = array([1,2]);
But notice that you cannot add two vectors that do not have the same number of
components.
Scalar Multiplication
Scalar multiplication is similarly naturally implemented:
d = 3*a
print(d)
[3 6 0]
6.1 Vectors 145
Componentwise Operations
Notice that there is room for error because of the way commands are interpreted.
For example, if you add a scalar to a vector, this is interpreted as a componentwise
addition: The scalar is added to each of the components:
e = a + 3
print(e)
[4 5 3]
Dot Product
The dot product is found by applying the function dot, which returns a scalar:
f = dot(a,b)
print(f)
-6
A common application of the dot product is to find the component of a vector a along
the direction given by a vector b. In general, b, is not a unit vector. We therefore first
need to find a unit vector in the direction of b:
ub = b
|b| , (6.22)
and the component of a in this direction is given by the dot product:
a b = a · ub = a · b
|b| . (6.23)
Numerically, this is done in exactly the same way:
ab = dot(a,b)/sqrt(dot(b,b));
print(ab)
Notice that we use the relation:
|b| = √b · b , (6.24)
for the magnitude of b.
Time Sequences of Vectors
We will often work with a sequence of vectors, corresponding to the time evolution
of a vector. For example, we may be interested in the position, r, or the force, F, as
a function of time, t:
146 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
r(t) and F(t) . (6.25)
Numerically, we will have a corresponding sequence of positions or forces at discrete
times, ti :
ri = r(ti ) and Fi = F(ti ) . (6.26)
Fortunately, it is simple to both represent and apply mathematical operations to an
element in a sequence.
We generate a sequence of n vectors ri with x, y, and z coordinates by:
n = 10
r = zeros((n,3),float)
We can use mathematical vector operations directly on element in the sequence, as
illustrated in the following example:
v = array([1.0,-2.0,2.0])
n = 10
r = zeros((n,3),float)
r[0] = array([0,0,0]);
dt = 0.1
r[1] = r[0] + v*dt
6.2 Description of Motion
The cheetah is the world fastest land animal. How can we characterize its motion as
it chases its prey? How fast does it run and how fast does it turn?
Motion Diagram and Position Vector
Figure 6.2 shows a few frames from a movie of a cheetah chasing a Thompson gazelle.
To quantify the motion we generate a motion diagram: We mark the position of the
cheetah at regular time intervals and record the positions r(ti ) of the cheetah relative
to the origin at time ti .
We are free to choose the origin and the axes of the coordinate system. The
origin determines where we measure the positions from. In Fig. 6.2 we have chosen
a stationary point on the ground as the origin. In addition to the origin, a coordinate
system consists of a set of axes that we use to decompose the position vector. The
directions of the axes indicate the positive direction of the corresponding unit vector.
The position can be decomposed along the x, y, and z-axes respectively (Table 6.1):
r(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j + z(t) k , (6.27)
where x(t), y(t), and z(t) are lengths along the axes and hence have units of length.
For example, the position at t = 0.5 s is:

find the complete dataset in the file cheetah.d. 2 Each line gives ti , x i , yi , where ti is
measured in seconds, and x i and yi are measured in meters. We have tabulated the
positions at Δt = 0.5 s intervals in the following table:
2 http://folk.uio.no/malthe/mechbook/cheetah.d.
148 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
Velocity Vector
Figure 6.2 shows how the position changes over a time interval Δt. The change in
position is also a vector and is called the displacement. The displacement from
t = 1.0 s to t = 2.0 s is denoted Δr(1.0 s):
Δr(1.0 s) = r(2.0 s) − r(1.0 s) = (46.6 m i + 31.3 m j) − (29.9 m i + 19.0 m j)
= 16.7 m i + 12.3 m j .
(6.29)
We can read the displacement directly from the motion diagram in Fig. 6.2 as the
vector from r(1.0 s) to r(2.0 s). Because the displacement depends on a difference
between two positions, it does not depend on the choice of origin.
We see from Fig. 6.2 that both the length and the direction of the displacement
vectors are changing throughout the motion. The rate of change of the displacement,
the velocity, must therefore also be a vector:
The average velocity from a time t = t0 to a time t = t0 + Δt is defined as:
¯v(t0) = r(t0 + Δt) − r(t0)
Δt = Δr(t0)
Δt . (6.30)
It is measured in meters per second, m/s.
We find the average velocity at t = 1.0 s using the data in the table above:
¯v(1.0 s) = Δr(1.0 s)
1.0 s = 16.7 m
1.0 s i + 12.3 m
1.0 s j = 16.7 m/s i + 12.3 m/s j . (6.31)
If we instead use a time interval Δt = 0.5 s to find the average velocity at t = 1.0 s
we find:
Δr(1.0 s) = r(1.5 s) − r(1.0 s) = (38.9 m i + 26.1 m j) − (29.9 m i + 19.0 m j)
= 9.0 m i + 7.1 m j ,
(6.32)
¯v(1.0 s) = Δr(1.0 s)
Δt = 1
0.5 s (9.0 m i + 7.1 m j) = 18.0 m/s i + 14.2 m/s j .
(6.33)
We see that the average velocity depends on the time interval Δt, just as we saw
in the one-dimensional case. Again, we can understand this better by studying the
displacement at t = 1.0 s for smaller and smaller time intervals Δt, as shown in
Fig. 6.3. We see that as Δt becomes smaller, the displacement also becomes smaller,
but its direction approaches the tangent to the curve describing the motion around
t = 1.0 s.

The instantaneous velocity at the time t is defined as the limit of the average
velocity when the time interval Δt goes to zero, that is, the time derivative of
the position vector, r(t).
v(t) = lim
Δt→0
Δr(t)
Δt = lim
Δt→0
r(t + Δt) − r(t)
Δt = dr
dt . (6.34)
Whenever we use the term velocity, we will mean the instantaneous velocity.
The velocity vector is tangential to the trajectory.
Speed
The magnitude of the velocity vector is called the speed, v, defined as:
v(t) = |v(t)| . (6.35)
We use the word velocity for the velocity vector, and the word speed for the magnitude
of the vector velocity.
Time Derivatives of Vector Functions
How do we find the derivative of a vector function such as r(t)? The simplest approach
is to write the vector in terms of the unit vectors for the coordinate system, and then
take the derivative of each component:
v(t) = d
dt r(t) = d
dt (x(t) i + y(t) j + z(t) k) = dx
dt i + dy
dt j + dz
dt k , (6.36)
150 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
where3 we define the component-wise velocities as
v x (t) = dx
dt , v y (t) = dy
dt , v z (t) = dz
dt . (6.37)
The velocity vector can therefore also be written:
v(t) = v x (t) i + v y (t) j + v z (t) k = (v x (t), v y (t), v z (t)) . (6.38)
Acceleration
It is clear from Fig. 6.2 that the average velocity of the cheetah is not constant through-
out the motion—it is varying both in direction and magnitude. Just as we introduced
velocity to characterize the change in the position vector, we introduce the acceler-
ation vector to characterize the change in the velocity vector:
The average acceleration vector over a time interval Δt from t to t + Δt is
defined as:
¯a = v(t + Δt) − v(t)
Δt . (6.39)
We define the instantaneous acceleration vector, or simply the instantaneous
acceleration, as the limit of the average acceleration vector when the time
interval approaches zero:
a(t) = lim
Δt→0
v(t + Δt) − v(t)
Δt = dv
dt = ˙v . (6.40)
The acceleration vector is the time derivative of the velocity vector.
We find the acceleration in the vector component representation by componentwise
derivation:
a(t) = d
dt v = d
dt
(v x i + v y j + v z k)
= dv x
dt i + dv y
dt j + dv z
dt k = a x (t) i + a y (t) j + a z (t) k , (6.41)
where we see that:
a x (t) = dv x
dt , a y (t) = dv y
dt , a z (t) = dv z
dt . (6.42)
3 Here we have implicitly assumed that the time derivatives of the unit vectors are zero. This is not
necessarily the case: The unit vectors vary with time for rotating reference systems.
6.2 Description of Motion 151
Since the velocity vector is the time derivative of the position vector
v(t) = d
dt r(t) , (6.43)
we can write the acceleration vector as the second time derivative of the position

a(t) = d
dt v = d
dt

dt r = d2r
dt2 , (6.44)
which can be written on component form:
a x (t) = dv x
dt = d2 x
dt2 , a y (t) = dv y
dt = d2 y
dt2 , a z (t) = dv z
dt = d2z
dt2 . (6.45)
Notation for Time Derivatives
In physics, we use both the differential form, d/dt and the dot notation for time
derivatives:
v = dr
dt = ˙r , (6.46)
and
a = dv
dt = ˙v = ¨r , (6.47)
but we do not use the “marked” notation, v x = x′(t), often used in mathematics
because we often use x′(t) to mean the position x measured in another coordinate
system. We therefore strongly recommend you to use the notations introduced here,
either the d/dt notation or the dot-notation.
Interpretation of Motion Diagrams
It is often takes time to gain a good intuition for acceleration, in particular for two- and
three-dimensional motions. Motion diagrams can help in developing that intuition
by visualizing velocities and accelerations.
If the motion diagram is drawn using a constant time interval Δt, we can use the
displacement vector as a visualization of the velocity, since the velocity is propor-
tional to the displacement:

Fig. 6.4 Motion diagrams for the cheetah with Δt = 0.5 s illustrating both the displacements, inter-
preted as velocities, and the change in displacements, interpreted as accelerations. The constructions
of the accelerations are illustrated
¯v(ti ) = 1
Δt Δr(ti ) . (6.48)
The displacement vectors are illustrated by red vectors at intervals of 0.5 and 0.25 s
in Fig. 6.4.
Notice that if we want to look at the change in velocity at the time t = 1.0 s,
we would like to compare the velocity before the time t = 1.0 s with the velocity
after the time t = 1.0 s. Now, the average velocity at the time t = 1.0 s is really the
average velocity over the time interval from 1.0 to 1.5 s. And the average velocity
at the time t = 0.5 s is the average velocity over the time interval from 0.5 to 1.0 s.
Therefore, a reasonable way to characterize the change in velocity at t = 1.0 s is to
characterize it as the change in velocity over the time interval from 0.5 t to 1.5 s:
Δ¯v(1.0 s) = ¯v(1.0 s) − ¯v(0.5 s) . (6.49)
We can interpret this as the average acceleration of the cheetah at t = 1.0 s, since it
is (approximately) proportional to the average acceleration:
¯a(1.0 s)  1
Δt (¯v(1.0 s) − ¯v(0.5 s)) . (6.50)
This method therefore provides a way to use the motion diagram to find approxi-
mations for the acceleration vectors in each point on the motion diagram. Incidentally,
this method is the same as the simplest numerical method to find the second order
time derivative of the position vector.
6.2 Description of Motion 153
1. We find the displacements, Δr:
Δr(t) = r(t + Δt) − r(t) , (6.51)
and interpret these as average velocity vectors for the motion.
2. We find the change in displacements, ΔΔr:
ΔΔr(t) = Δr(t) − Δr(t − Δt) , (6.52)
and interpret these as average acceleration vectors for the motion.
We have illustrated the motion diagram of the cheetah using this approach in
Fig. 6.4. Notice that we can generate the average acceleration vectors by a graphical
vector subtraction, as illustrated at t = 1.0 s in Fig. 6.4.
6.2.1 Example: Mars Express
This example demonstrates how we can find the velocity and acceleration from both
real data and mathematical representations of the position—based on real data
provided by ESA.
The Mars Express probe was launched on June 2nd 2003 and reached Mars in
December 2003 (see ESA’s site for more information on Mars Express). We want to
use the data provided by ESA to illustrate the motion of the Mars Express, analyze
the velocity and acceleration of the module, and compare with the motion of the
Earth and Mars (see Fig. 6.5).

154 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
Reading and converting the data: The path of the Mars Express from Earth to Mars
is approximately given by the data set marsexpresslr.d,4 which has been reduced to be
strictly two-dimensional. Each line in the data set contains the following information:
t1 x1 y1 z1
t2 x2 y2 z2
. . . . . . . . . . . .
The time is given in days, and the spatial coordinates are measured in kilometers.
We read the data set into Python to examine the motion, using loadtxt:
from pylab import *
t,x,y=loadtxt(’marsexpresslr.d’,usecols=[0,1,2],unpack=True)
n = len(t)
dt = t[1] - t[0]
r = zeros((n,2),float)
r[:,0] = x
r[:,1] = y
This generates the arrays t, x, and y, which we combine to one array to form r.
This provides us with a vector r(ti ), which contains the x- and y-components
r(ti ) = x(ti ) i + y(ti ) j . (6.53)
The vector representation in Python is useful and allows us to make operations on the
whole vector in a very similar way to how we write the operations mathematically.
We demonstrate this by converting the lengths to astronomical units. The x- and y-
coordinates in the data-set are measured in kilometers, but we would like to measure
lengths in Astronomical Units, where 1AU = 149,598,000 km. An astronomical unit
(1 AU) roughly corresponds to the average radius of the orbit of the Earth around the
Sun—it is therefore a useful unit for describing planetary motion. We can convert
the data by dividing the length by 1 AU. Mathematically, we would write this as:
r′(t) = 1
1 AU r(t) . (6.54)
Using the vector representation, the implementation in Python is almost identical:
AU = 149598000.0
r = r/AU
How does this work? The command r/a divides each element in the array by a =
1 AU—both the x and the y coordinate for all times i. This is a very intuitive and
efficient way of coding, and you should learn to utilize the power of vectorization.
Plotting the trajectory—Low resolution data: The data-set provides the positions
ri at times ti . We can visualize the trajectory by plotting all the positions of the
module:

6.2 Description of Motion 155
plot(r[:,0],r[:,1])
axis(’equal’)
xlabel(’x [au]’)
ylabel(’y [au]’)
show()
where we have used axis(’equal’) to ensure that the scaling of the x- and y-
axis are the same, so that a circle will appear as a circle and not as an ellipse. Notice
that r[:,0] gives the x i for all i, and similarly for the yi .
The resulting trajectory is shown by a dotted line in Fig. 6.6a. Unfortunately, this
data-set only contains the position of the module every 30 days. This only gives us a
coarse illustration of the motion, but we are still able to see the main features.
Motion diagram: The plot of the trajectory itself does not provide much insight into
the motion of the module. We can gain more insight through a motion diagram or by
calculating the velocity and acceleration of the module along the trajectory. Since
the data is so coarse, we start by illustrating the velocities and the accelerations in
the diagrams.
The average velocity is proportional to the displacement:
¯vi = 1
Δt Δri = 1
Δt (r(ti+1) − r(ti )) . (6.55)
We can therefore illustrate the velocities by drawing the displacement vectors from
ri to ri+1 . This is done by drawing an arrow from r[i,:] to r[i+1,:] using
the quiver command, which draws an arrow from a point ri and in a distance
Δri = ri+1 −ri . Notice the additional arguments provided to the quiver command
to ensure that the arrows have correct length and orientation. Also remember to replot
the previous figure and to add show() at the end of the script.
for i in range(n-1):
plot(r[i,0],r[i,1],’o’)
dr = r[i+1,:] - r[i,:]
quiver(r[i,0],r[i,1],dr[0],dr[1],angles=’xy’,
scale_units=’xy’,scale=1)
show()
The loop stops at n−1, since we cannot find the displacement from i = n to i = n+1.
The arrow illustrating the (average) velocities are shown in Fig. 6.6a.
Similarly, the acceleration is approximately given by the change in velocities:
a  1
Δt (v(ti ) − v(ti−1)) , (6.56)
We use the velocities in ti and ti−1 because the velocity in ti is calculated from the
points ti and ti+1 and the velocity in ti−1 is calculated from the points ti−1 and ti . In
this way, the acceleration is properly centered. This becomes clear by reviewing the
motion diagram in Fig. 6.6a. To find the acceleration in point 1, we need to use the
velocities (displacements) from point 0 and 1.

Fig. 6.6 The trajectory of the Mars Express spacecraft illustrated as a motion diagram. The circles
shows the position of the module at 30 day intervals, the arrows indicate the velocities (displace-
ments) and the accelerations (change in displacements)
We can therefore illustrate the accelerations by:
a  1
Δt2 ((ri+1 − ri ) − (ri − ri−1)) . (6.57)
which is implemented as:
for i in range(1,n-1):
plot(r[i,0],r[i,1],’o’)
dr = (r[i+1,:] - r[i,:])-(r[i,:] - r[i-1,:])
quiver(r[i,0],r[i,1],dr[0],dr[1],angles=’xy’,
scale_units=’xy’,scale=1)
show()
The accelerations are shown in Fig. 6.6a. Already from this very simple figure we
gain insight into the motion: The acceleration is toward the center of the trajectory
and the acceleration is decreasing in magnitude since the length of the arrows are
decreasing.
Plotting the trajectory—High resolution data: Fortunately, we have access to data
with much higher time resolution in the file marsexpresshr.d.5 We read and plot the
data using the same method as before:
from pylab import *
t,x,y=loadtxt(’marsexpresshr.d’,usecols=[0,1,2],unpack=True)
n = len(t)
r = zeros((n,2),float)
r[:,0] = x
r[:,1] = y

r = r/AU

xlabel(’x [au]’)
ylabel(’y [au]’)
show()
5 http://folk.uio.no/malthe/mechbook/marsexpresshr.d.
6.2 Description of Motion 157
The resulting trajectory is shown in Fig. 6.6b. In this case, the density of points is so
high that it does not make sense to plot the displacements—they are all very small.
Calculating velocity and acceleration: The velocity at ti is the time derivative of
r(t) at ti , which we approximate by the numerical derivative over the time interval
Δt, when Δt is small:
v(ti ) = dr
dt = lim
Δt→0
r(ti + Δt) − r(ti )
Δt  r(ti + Δt) − r(ti )
Δt . (6.58)
Notice that this is exactly the same form we used to calculate the displacement in
the motion diagram. We can therefore calculate the velocities numerically using the
same approach:
n = len(r)
dt = t[1]-t[0]
v = zeros((n,2),float)
for i in range (n-1):
v[i,:] = (r[i+1,:]-r[i,:])/dt
The magnitude of the velocity, v(t), is shown in Fig. 6.7.
Similarly, we approximate the acceleration using the numerical derivative of the
velocity:
a(ti )  v(ti ) − v(ti−1)
Δt , (6.59)
which again is analogous to what we calculated in the motion diagrams:
a = zeros((n,2),float)
for i in range(2,n-1):
a[i,:] = (v[i,:] - v[i-1,:])/dt

Figure 6.7 shows that the acceleration is decreasing in magnitude as the module moves
from the Earth to Mars, but the data is noisier for the acceleration. The magnitudes
of velocity and acceleration are calculated using the norm-function.
vv = zeros((n,1),float)
aa = zeros((n,1),float)
for i in range(n):
vv[i] = norm(v[i,:])
aa[i] = norm(a[i,:])
Mathematical models: Since we do not have any intuition for velocities or acceler-
ations of space travel such as for the Mars Express, we need to compare with other
relevant motions, such as the motion of the Earth and Mars around the Sun. For
simplicity, we assume that both the Earth and Mars follow circular orbits with radi
R E = 1 au and R M = 1.5 au, and periods (the time a complete revolution takes) of
T E = 1 year = 365.25 days and T M = 2 years = 730.5 days. The trajectory for a
circular orbit with radius R and period T can be described by
r(t) = R (i cos ωt + j sin ωt) , (6.60)
where ω = 2π/T . This describes a circle with radius R and the trajectory is at
r = Ri at t = 0 and at t = T , hence the period is T . If you are not familiar with this
representation of circles, you can plot the trajectory by
>> R = 1.0
>> T = 365.25
>> t = linspace(0,TE,1000)
>> r = R*array([cos(2*pi*t/T) sin(2*pi*t/T)])
>> plot(r[0,:],rE[1,:]), axis(’equal’)
We are here primarily interested in the velocity and acceleration of a planet in the
trajectory, and not in when the planet is where along the trajectory. Therefore we
have not taken care to ensure that the initial positions at t = 0 for Mars or the Earth
are correct relative to each other. (That is, we do not care where the planets are at
t = 0).
We use this representation for both the Earth and Mars. The velocity of the planet
in this circular orbit is
v = dr
dt = d
dt R (i cos ωt + j sin ωt) = Rω (−i sin ωt + j cos ωt) . (6.61)
The magnitude of the velocity is therefore a constant:
|v| = Rω |−i sin ωt + j cos ωt| = Rω = 2π R/T , (6.62)
which corresponds to the distance traveled during one complete revolution divided
by the time it takes to make a revolution. We therefore now have numbers we can use
to compare with the results from our calculations. For the Earth (v E ) and for Mars
(v M ) we find:
v E = 2 π 1.0 au/ (365.25 days) = 0.017 au/days , (6.63)
6.2 Description of Motion 159
v M = 2 π 1.5 au/ (2 365.25 days) = 0.013 au/days . (6.64)
These values are illustrated by a dotted and a dashed line in Fig. 6.7. Indeed, we
see that the Mars Express holds approximately the same velocity as Mars when the
module approaches Mars, and that the module starts with a velocity significantly
larger than that of the Earth in its orbit.
We find the acceleration for these trajectories from the derivative of the velocity:
a = dv
dt = d
dt Rω (−i sin ωt + j cos ωt) = −Rω2 (i cos ωt + j sin ωt) , (6.65)
which shows that the acceleration of the Earth (and Mars) always points in toward
the center of the orbit. The magnitude of the acceleration is a constant, a = Rω2 ,
which gives
a E =
(
2 2 π2 1.0 au
)
/ (365.25 days)2 = 3.00 × 10−4 au/days 2 , (6.66)
a M =
(
2 2 π2 1.5 au
)
/ (2 365.25 days)2 = 1.11 × 10−4 au/days 2 . (6.67)
We have plotted these values as dotted (Earth) and dashed (Mars) lines in Fig. 6.7.
We see that the acceleration of the module is the same as the acceleration of the Earth
when it is near the Earth and Mars when it is near Mars.
We can also plot the trajectories of the Earth and Mars into the plot of the trajectory
of the Mars Express. First, we calculate the trajectories and then plot them in the
same plot:
hold(’on’)
RE = 1.0 TE = 365.25
tt = linspace(0,TE,1000)
omegaE = 2*pi/TE
rE = RE*transpose(array([cos(omegaE*tt) sin(omegaE*tt)]))
plot(rE[:,0],rE[:,1],’:’)
RM = 1.5
TM = 2*365.25
tt = linspace(0,TM,1000)
omegaE = 2*pi/TE
rM = RM*transpose(array([cos(omegaM*tt) sin(omegaM*tt)]))
plot(rM[:,0],rM[:,1],’--’)
hold(’off’)
show()
Notice the compact way of calculating the trajectory. First, we generate an array tt
of time from 0 days to the period T , and then we generate the x and y positions.
Notice also the use of transpose (using the transpose function) to ensure that the
vectors have the shape (N , 2) and not (2, N ). The resulting trajectories are shown in
Fig. 6.6.
Analysis of acceleration: We can use the data-set to find out how the magnitude
of the acceleration depends on the distance, r, to the Sun. The distance, r, is the
magnitude of the position vector, since all the positions are measured with the Sun in
160 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions

the origin of the coordinate system. The magnitude of the position vector is r(t) = |r|.
We have already found the magnitude of the velocity and the acceleration, and we
can find the norm of the position in the same way:
rr = zeros((n,1),float)
for i in range(n):
rr[i] = norm(r[i,:])
Let us now test the hypothesis that the acceleration is inversely proportional to the
distance to the Sun, which is the essence of Newton’s law of gravitation:
a(r) = c
r2 , (6.68)
where c is a constant. We test this idea by plotting a as a function of 1/r2 . If the
resulting graph is a straight line, we have shown that the acceleration indeed is
described by Newton’s law of gravitation. The resulting plot is shown in Fig. 6.8.
The plot shows that the data is consistent with Newton’s law of gravitation, except
for in the initial phase. However, in this case we expect the spacecraft to be affected
by other effects, such as the effect of the engine driving it, and the gravitational force
from the Earth.
6.3 Calculation of Motion
We are typically not given a description of the motion, instead we have measured
the velocity or the acceleration or we have a theory for the acceleration, and we want
to determine the motion. This requires us to integrate the equations of motion. Thus
we need methods to determine the motion of an object in two and three dimensions
given a set of measurements of the velocity or the acceleration, given a mathematical
expression for the velocity or the acceleration, or given a differential equation for
the velocity or acceleration. Here we equip you with the methods needed to actually
solve mechanics problems.

Discrete Integration
In your line of work as a tornado chaser you have just developed a tornado probe,
a small spherical ball you plan to shoot through a tornado to measure the wind
velocities. The probe is fitted with a tiny accelerometer based on a MEMS-device (a
micro-electromechanical system) that records the acceleration of the probe in the x,
y, and z-directions every 0.01 s. After the flight, you recover the probe and read out
the accelerations. How can you use these readings to find the velocity and position
of the probe during its flight?
The acceleration was recorded at a sequence of times, ti , with constant time inter-
vals, Δt = 0.01 s, as shown in Fig. 6.9. We want to use this sequence of accelerations,
a(ti ) to find both the sequence of velocities, v(ti ), and the sequence of positions, r(ti )
of the probe. Just as for one-dimensional motion, we use the expression for the numer-
ical derivative of the velocity, the average acceleration, to determine the velocities.
The average acceleration vector from the time ti to ti+1 = ti + Δt is:
¯a(ti ) = v(ti + Δt) − v(ti )
Δt . (6.69)
We solve for v(ti + Δt) to step forward in time:
v(ti + Δt) − v(ti ) = Δt · ¯a(ti ) (6.70)
v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + Δt · ¯a(ti ) .
Even though the accelerometer does not provide the average acceleration during
a time interval, but rather the instantaneous acceleration at the time, t0 , we get a
162 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
reasonable approximation by assuming that the average acceleration is equal to the
instantaneous acceleration:
¯a(t0)  a(ti ) . (6.71)
Indeed, this corresponds to the approximation used in the first order numerical deriv-
ative.
This produces a sequence of velocities, v(ti ). We can now use exactly the same
procedure to find the positions from the velocities, since the velocity is the time
derivative of the position. The velocity from time ti to ti+1 = ti +Δt is approximately
gives as the average velocity:
v(ti )  r(ti + Δt) − r(ti )
Δt , (6.72)
which we again can solve for r(ti + Δt) getting:
r(ti + Δt) − r(ti )  Δt · v(ti ) (6.73)
r(ti Δt)  r(ti ) + Δt · v(ti ) .
We can now find the position and velocities of the probe, starting at t0 = 0s:
1. At t = t0 = 0 s the probe is launched from r0 = −80.0 m i with a velocity
v(t0) = v0 = 184.9 m/s i − 18.5 m/s j + 74.0 m/s k:
v(0.0 s) = 184.9 m/s i − 18.5 m/s j + 74.0 m/s k , (6.74)
r(0.0 s) = −80.0 m i + 0.0 m j + 0.0 m k . (6.75)
2. At t1 = t0 + Δt = 0.01 s, the velocity vector is:
v(0.01 s)  v(0.0 s) + Δt a(0.0 s) = 178.0 m/s i − 18.1 m/s j + 71.1 textm/s k ,
(6.76)
where the acceleration a(0.0 s) = −683.1 m/s 2 i + 41.1 m/s 2 j − 283.0 m/s2 k is
listed in the table in Fig. 6.9. The position vector of the probe is:
r(0.01 s)  r(0.0 s) + Δt v(0.0 s) = −78.2 m i − 0.18 m j + 0.73 m k . (6.77)
This trajectory is illustration in Fig. 6.10, where we have also illustrated the velocity
field of the tornado. We will return to this example with a more physical approach
in the next chapter.
The method we have presented here is called Euler’s method for integration.
However, just as for one-dimensional motion, a small modification of the method
makes it stronger: If we instead use the newly calculated velocity, v(ti + Δt) when
we calculate the new positions, we get Euler-Cromer’s method , which usually has

for the probe. The circles

higher precision and is more stable than Euler method. We will therefore usually use
this method here.
In Euler-Cromer’s method we find the position vector, r(ti ), and the velocity
vector, v(ti ), as a function of time by a stepwise summation of the acceleration
vectors a(ti ), starting from v(t0) = v0 and r(t0) = r0 :
v(ti + Δt)  v(ti ) + Δt a(ti )
r(ti + Δt)  r(ti ) + Δt v(ti + Δt) (6.78)
We have implemented this method in a short program that finds the velocities and
positions of the probe. You can find the components of the acceleration vector in the
file tornado.d6 recorded at an interval Δt = 0.01 s, where each line contains a time
(in seconds) and the x- and y-components of the accelerations (a x and a y ) given in

Formal Integration
If we know a mathematical expression for the acceleration vector, we can find the
velocity and position vector by integration. We start from the acceleration and inte-
grate from t0 to t to find the velocity:
dv
dt = a(t) ⇒
∫ t
t0
dv
dt dt = v(t) − v(t0) =
∫ t
t0
a(t) dt . (6.79)
This allows you to find the velocity from the acceleration. If the acceleration is on
component form, you integrate each component to find the velocity:
∫ t
t0 a(t) dt = ∫ t
t0
(a x (t) i + a y (t) j + a z (t) k) dt
=
(∫ t
t0 a x (t) dt
)
i +
(∫ t
t0 a y (t) dt
)
j +
(∫ t
t0 a z (t) dt
)
k . (6.80)
When we have the velocity, we find the position by integration:
∫ t
t0
dr
dt dt = r(t) − r(t0) =
∫ t
t0
v(t)dt ⇒ r(t) = r(t0) +
∫ t
t0
v(t)dt . (6.81)
We insert the result for v(t) from (6.79) to find the position:
r(t) = r(t0) + ∫ t
t0 v(t) dt
= r(t0) + ∫ t
t0
(
v(t0) + ∫ t

= r(t0) + v(t0) (t − t0) + ∫ t

(∫ t

)
dt
(6.82)
6.3 Calculation of Motion 165
These two equations provide the integration method to solve the equations of
motion and find the position r(t) and velocity v(t) vectors from the acceleration
vector, a(t):
v(t) = v(t0) + ∫ t
t0 a(t)dt
r(t) = r(t0) + v(t0) (t − t0) + ∫ t
t0
(∫ t
t0 a(t)dt
)
dt (6.83)
Again there is no need to memorize these equations. They follow from your knowl-
edge of calculus. Instead, you should learn how to use your experience from calculus
to find these equations when you need them. In this way, it is simpler for you to
remember this result simply as a special case: The solution of the initial value prob-
lem when the acceleration is only a function of time.
Motion with Constant Acceleration
The integration method can use used to find the motion of an object moving with a
constant acceleration, a(t) = a0 , starting from r(t0) = r0 and with initial velocity
v(t0) = v0 :
v(t) = v(t0) +
∫ t
t0
a0 dt = v0 + a0 (t − t0) . (6.84)
and
r(t) = r(t0) + ∫ t
t0 v(t) dt
= r0 + ∫ t
t0 (v0 + a0 (t − t0)) dt
= r0 + ∫ t
t0 v0 dt + ∫ t
t0 a0 (t − t0) dt
= r0 + v0 (t − t0) + 1
2 a0 (t − t0)2 .

Differential Equations
In mechanics we want to calculate the motion of an object based on the forces acting
on the object. Therefore, you learn to gradually build more advanced models for the
forces acting on an object. Using these models, you can apply Newton’s second law to
find the acceleration of the object. Finally, you find the velocity and position vector of
the object as a function of time based on the expression you have for the acceleration
and the initial values of the position and velocity. We called this general procedure
“the structured problem-solving approach”, and it is illustrated in Fig. 6.11.

Fig. 6.11 Illustration of the structured problem-solving approach
So far, we have addressed the case when you have measured the acceleration vec-
tor, a(t), either for only a discrete number of time steps, or you can have a theoretical
prediction for the acceleration for all times. However, usually, we do not know how
the acceleration of an object varies in time, but we rather have models for how the
acceleration depends on the position of the object, or the velocity of the object. For
a probe scrambling through a tornado, it is the position and velocity of the probe
relative to the tornado that determine the forces acting on it and therefore its accel-
eration. In this case, we cannot integrate the acceleration, because the acceleration
also depends on velocity and position.
Generally, modeling the forces and applying Newton’s second law leads to an
expression:
d2r
dt2 = a(r, v, t) = a
(
r, dr
dt , t
)
(6.86)
For example, a viscous force model leads to an acceleration:
d2r
dt2 = a = −cv = −c dr
dt , (6.87)
and a spring force model leads to an acceleration on the form:
d2r
dt2 = a = −Cr r
r . (6.88)
We see that the unknown function, r(t), occurs on both sides of the equality—
therefore we cannot simply integrate over time to find the solution. These are exam-
ples of differential equations. In some cases they can be solved using analytical tech-
niques, but in most cases we will need to turn to numerical methods. Fortunately, in
many cases the numerical solution of these differential equations can be done using
methods identical to the methods we have developed for direct integration.
6.3 Calculation of Motion 167
One of the major steps in the structured problem-solving approach is the “Solver”,
where you find the time evolution of the velocity and position vectors from an equa-
tion for the acceleration and the initial conditions:
d2r
dt2 = a
(
r, dr
dt , t
)
, v(t0) = v0 , r(t0) = r0 . (6.89)
The result of the “Solver” step is the velocity and position as a function of time, either
as continuous, mathematical functions, v(t), and r(t), or as the numerical solutions
of the equations calculated at discrete time steps, v(ti ) and r(ti ). However, unless the
time resolution, ti , is determined by the time intervals of an experimental data-set,
your numerical solution can be found at any time resolution you like.
Numerical Solution
We have seen several examples of how to find the numerical solution when the
acceleration or velocity vectors are given functions of time. Let us now illustrate a
general approach that also works for a differential equation of the form in (6.89). We
know the initial position and velocity at t = t0 . The acceleration at t = t0 is therefore
given by (6.89). Let us to find the velocity and position at t = t1 after a small time
interval Δt at t1 = t0 + Δt. We use Euler-Cromer’s method to find the new velocity
vector based on the acceleration vector at t = t0 , and then to find the new position
based on the position at t = t0 and the velocity at t = t1 :
v(t0 + Δt)  v(t0) + Δt a(t0, r(t0), v(t0)) (6.90)
r(t0 + Δt)  r(t0) + Δt v(t0 + Δt) . (6.91)
We can continue this method iteratively, finding in sequence first t1 , then t2 and so
on, until we have reached the time t.
In Euler-Cromer’s method we solve the (second order) initial value problem:
d2r
dt2 = a
(
r, dr
dt , t
)
, v(t0) = v0 , r(t0) = r0 . (6.92)
using the following iterative procedure:
v(ti + Δt)  v(ti ) + Δt a(ti , r(ti ), v(ti ))
r(ti + Δt)  r(ti ) + Δt v(ti + Δt) (6.93)
168 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
You should in general think of the “Solver” as a call to a numerical function that
returns the position and velocity vectors given the functional form of the acceleration
and the initial conditions. When you grow up to become a professional physicist,
you will have built your own set of methods and tools, numerical and analytical, to
“Solve” problems. In particular, we advice you to use a fourth order Runge-Kutta
method as your preferred method of numerical integration, although in this book
we will focus on clarity and simplicity instead, and typically use Euler-Cromer’s
method, unless this produces significant errors.
6.3.1 Example: Feather in the Wind
In this example you learn to find the position and velocity from the acceleration,
when the acceleration is given by a simplified mathematical model, and when it is
given by a differential equation.
You are planning to reproduce the introductory film in Forrest Gump—by cap-
turing the motion of a feather caught in the wind. You plan to start with a feather
dropped from a lift, at a height h above the ground. A slight wind is blowing. Our
task is to find the motion of the feather, given its acceleration.
Sketch: As always, a good sketch solves half the problem. For simplicity we assume
that the motion is two-dimensional. Figure 6.12 shows a sketch of the path of the
feather, including the velocity of the wind.
Simplified model—Free fall: The simplest, and least realistic, model for the falling
feather is to assume that it falls without air resistance. We release the feather with
a horizontal velocity equal to that of the wind, v0 = w, and then assume that it has
constant acceleration, a = −gj. We can then find the motion by integration.
a = −g j (6.94)

and we release the feather at time t0 = 0 s wt r(0) = h j with v(0) = v0 = w. We
find the velocity by direct integration:
v(t) = v(t0) +
∫ t
t0
a dt = w +
∫ t
0
−g j dt = w − gt j . (6.95)
We can simplify this a bit further if the wind is horizontal, w = w i:
v(t) = w i − gt j . (6.96)
We find the position by integrating once more over time:
r(t) = r(t0) + ∫ t
t0 v(t) dt = r0 + ∫ t
0 (w i − gt j) dt
= h j + wt i − 1
2 gt2 j . (6.97)
This gives us a complete solution for this simplified model, which is useful as a
comparison when we address the full model.
Realistic model: A more realistic model includes two additional effects: Air resis-
tance means that the acceleration depends on the velocity of the feather and the
velocity of the wind, and the wind typically varies near the ground. A better model
for the acceleration of the feather is:
a = −g j − C|v − w| (v − w) , (6.98)
where w is the velocity of the wind. A realistic model for the wind is
w(r) = w0
(
1 − e−y/b)
, (6.99)
In this case, b = 5 m and w0 = 3 m/s i is the velocity of the wind. We drop the
feather from rest from a position r0 = h j, with h = 10 m.
Unfortunately, we cannot solve this equation exactly, but it is not difficult to solve
numerically. We apply Euler-Cromer’s method. We find the velocity and position at
time ti + Δt from the position and velocity at ti using:
v(ti + Δt)  v(ti ) + Δt a(ti , vi ) (6.100)
r(ti + Δt)  r(ti ) + Δt v(ti + Δt) . (6.101)
In addition, you are told that C = 30.0 m−1 for the feather.
Notice that the acceleration depends not only on the velocity v(t) of the feather,
but also on its position, because the velocity of the air, w, depends on the position
of the feather. We therefore first calculate w(r) and then calculate a(t, r, v). This is
implemented in the following program. Notice the use of vector notation to find the
acceleration.

The expression we have used for w(r) is only value when y > 0, and the feather hits
the ground when y = 0 m. We therefore only plot the trajectory when y > 0. This is
ensured using the find command.
The resulting path of the feather is illustrated in Fig. 6.13. Notice that the feather
almost immediately follows the wind—the drag forces rapidly reduces differences
between the velocity of the feather and the velocity of the surrounding air.
We can compare these results with the simplified, analytical solution we found
above. The simplified solution is illustrated by a dotted line, which clearly was not a
good solution, because the vertical acceleration is greatly reduced when the feather
moves fast in the horizontal direction.

6.4 Frames of Reference
Consider a person driving in an open convertible at constant velocity. She throws a
ball straight up into the air. According to her, the ball moves straight up along the
y-axis and falls straight down along the y-axis into her arms. A simple feat. However,
a spectator standing by the road tells a different story. He observed the person in the
car throwing the ball with an initial horizontal as well as vertical velocity component
in a curved, parabolic path, and then she caught the ball exactly as it fell back to its
original height. A more impressive feat as seen from the sidewalk. The two stories
are illustrated in Fig. 6.14. In this section we address how we can relate these two
observations.
The motion of the ball can be described in a reference system S, on the sidewalk,
and in a reference system S′ which moves with the car. The position of the ball as
measured in system S at a time t (measured in S) is r(t). Similar, the position of the
ball as measured in the system S′ at a time t′ (measured in S′) is r′(t′). The position
of the system S′ measured in system S is R. We can therefore relate the positions in
the two systems by:
r = R + r′ . (6.102)
Let us assume that the time is the same in all reference systems. That is, we assume
there is a universal time so that the time measured in system S is the same as the
time measured in system S′. As we will learn later, this is only approximately true
as long as the reference systems are not moving very fast relative to each other.
What is the velocity of the object measured in system S?
v = dr
dt = d
dt
(R + r′) = dR
dt + dr′
dt . (6.103)
System S′ is moving with a velocity u = dR/dt relative to system S—this is the
velocity of the car (system S′) in Fig. 6.14 relative to the sidewalk (system S). Since
172 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
we have assumed that the time is universal, we have that:
dr′(t′)
dt′ = v′ = r′(t)
dt , (6.104)
which is the vector velocity of the object measured in system S′. This corresponds
to the vector velocity of the ball measured from the car in Fig. 6.14.
The relation between the velocities is therefore
v = u + v′ . (6.105)
If system S′ moves at a constant velocity relative to system S, du/dt = 0, and the
accelerations of the object are the same inboth systems:
a = a′ . (6.106)
This transformation is called the Gallileo-transformation. The acceleration of an
object is the same in all systems moving at constant velocities relative to each other.
This means that the acceleration is an invariant in the Gallileo-transformations. We
call all systems moving at constant velocities inertial systems. Because Newton’s
laws determine the accelerations, Newton’s laws are only valid in inertial systems.
If we now return to the case of the car, we can explain the behavior. The accel-
eration of the ball is the same in a system on the ground and in all systems moving
at constant velocity relative to the ground. The car is such a system, moving with a
constant velocity u relative to the ground. The acceleration of the ball is therefore
the same in the sidewalk-system S and in the car’s system S′. However, the initial
velocities are different in the two systems. In system S′ the ball is thrown straight up,
which means that the initial velocity only has a component along the y′-axis of the S′
system: v′
0 = v0 j. In system S, the initial velocity has both a vertical and horizontal
component, because the relation between the two velocities are given by (6.105):
v = u + v′ = u i + v0 j , (6.107)
where u is the speed of the car in the horizontal direction. Seen from the car, it is
obvious that the ball falls down into the car, since it was thrown with no horizontal
velocity component relative to the car.
6.4.1 Example: Motion of a Boat on a Flowing River
In this example you will learn how to use transformations between frames of reference
to address the motion of a boat moving relative to a moving background—a river.
You are driving a boat on a river that flows with a velocity of 1.0 m/s southwards.
We will now discuss the motion of the boat in several scenarios: driving with a

constant speed relative to the water and driving with a speed given by the boat
speedometer, recorded at intervals of Δt = 0.1 s in the file boatvelocity.d.7
Sketch: We start by sketching the system: We sketch the boat and the surrounding
river in Fig. 6.15. It is important to draw all the coordinate systems we will be using:
We use a coordinate system S with axes x and y, which is on the riverbank, and a
system S′, with axes x′ and y′ which is following the motion of the river. The river
is flowing in the x-direction, and the x and x′ directions are parallel.
Position of the boat: The position of the boat in system S, which is stationary on
the riverbank, is r(t). The position of the boat in the system S′, which is following
the water in the river, is r′(t) and the two positions are related by:
r(t) = R(t) + r′(t) , (6.108)
where R(t) is the position of system S′ measured relative to system S.
Velocity of the boat: If we know the velocity of the boat relative to the water, v′
b,
then we find the velocity of the boat relative to the bank by taking the time derivative
of (6.108):
vb(t) = drb
dt = dR
dt + dr′
b
dt = u + v′
b . (6.109)
Driving straight across the river: We can use this result to find what velocity the
boat must have in order to drive straight across the river. To drive straight across
the river means that the boat should have no velocity along the riverbank, that is,
vb,x = 0. Since we know that u is directed along the x-axis, u = u i, the velocity of
the boat is:
vb = u i + v′
b , (6.110)
and on component form:

174 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
vb,x = u + v′
b,x , vb,y = v′
b,y . (6.111)
Straight across means that vb,x = 0, that is that
u + v′
b,x = 0 ⇒ v′
b,x = −u , (6.112)
and that v′
b,y can have any value you like.
Driving with constant velocity: If the boat is driving with a constant velocity v′
b,
what is the position of the boat after a time t? We can find the position in either
system S or in system S′—the result will be the same. If we find the position in
system S′ we need to transform the velocity first. The velocity of the boat in system
S is:
vb = u + v′
b , (6.113)
and the position is therefore:
rb(t) = r(t0) + ∫ t
t0 vb(t) dt = r(t0) + ∫ t
t0
(u + v′
b
) dt
= r(t0) + (u + v′
b
) (t − t0) . (6.114)
Driving with varying velocity: The velocity of the boat relative to the river, v′
b(t),
is recorded by the speedometer. We can therefore use (6.108) to find the velocity of
the boat relative to the ground. We notice that the velocity of the river is:
u = −1.0 m/s j . (6.115)
We integrate v(ti ) numerically to find the position of the boat relative to land using
Euler’s method:
rb(ti + Δt) = rb(ti ) + Δtvb(ti ) , (6.116)
where
vb(ti ) = u + v′
b(ti ) , (6.117)
where we find v′
b(ti ) in the data set in boatvelocity.d.8 This is implemented in the
following program:

Summary
Motion:
• The motion of an object is described by the position vector, r(t), as a function of
time, measured in a specified coordinate system.
• The velocity vector of the object is defined as
v(t) = dr
dt .
• The acceleration vector of the object is defined as
a(t) = dv
dt = d2r
dt2 .
176 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions
Problem-solving approach:
• We solve problems in kinematics using a structured approach.
• In the “Solver” we solve the equation:
d2r
dt2 = a
(
t, r, dr
dt
)
.
with the initial conditions r(t0) = r0 and v(t0) = v0 .
• Numerically: We solve the equation using an iterative approach starting from the
initial conditions. For example, we can use Euler-Cromer’s method:
v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + Δt a(r(ti ), v(ti ), ti )
r(ti + Δt) = r(ti ) + Δt v(ti + Δt) .
• Analytically: When the acceleration, a = a(t), is only a function of time, t, we
can solve the equations by direct integration:
v(t) = v(t0) +
∫ t
t0
a(t) dt ,
r(t) = r(t0) +
∫ t
t0
v(t) dt .
A typical example is motion with constant acceleration.
• The derivative of a vector function such as r(t) is found by componentwise deriva-
tion. If
r(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j + z(t) k ,
the derivative is:

6.20 Motion capture. In this project we will study the motion of an object that is
fitted with an accelerometer, and it is your task to figure out what physical phenom-
enon we are observing. You will need to find the motion from the acceleration of the
object, and then interpret the motion in physical terms.
First, we will guide your intuition by starting with an introductory, analytical
exercise.
A car rolling down a hill with an inclination θ with the horizon experiences an
acceleration a = g sin(θ) along the surface of the hill. Here g = 9.81 m/s 2 is the
acceleration of gravity. The car is released from rest at the time t = t0 = 0 s.

(b) Find the position s and the velocity v of the car along the hill after a time t.
We will now introduce a reference system S oriented with the x-axis in the hor-
izontal direction and the y-axis in the vertical direction—that is in the direction
gravity is acting. Let us assume that the car starts in the position x = 0 m, y = h,
where h is the height of the car, and that the car moves in the positive x-direction.

Chapter 7
Forces in Two and Three Dimensions
We have now introduced a vectorized description of motion that allows us to discuss
motion not only in one dimension, but also for two- and three-dimensional systems.
However, in order to predict and calculate the motion, we need to extend Newton’s
laws to two and three dimensions, and we need to introduce force models that are
applicable in two and three dimensions. This is the focus of the current chapter.
The structured problem-solving approach used to address problems in mechanics
has exactly the same form for one-, two-, and three-dimensional problems (See
Fig. 7.1 for an illustration). The first step is to identify what objects we are studying,
how we characterize their position, and what reference system we use to describe the
motion. Second, we model the system by finding the forces acting on the object, we
introduce models for the force, and use Newton’s second law to find the acceleration
of the object. Third, we solve the equations of motion, and determine the position
and velocity of the objects as functions of time. Finally, we analyze the resulting
motion, use the solution to answer the questions posed, and check the validity of the
solutions.
In this chapter, we discuss how to identify forces, how to apply Newton’s laws
in two- and three-dimensions, and we generalize all force models to two- and three-
dimensional motion.
7.1 Identifying Forces
In Chap. 5 we introduced a general method to identify and name the forces acting on
an object, by drawing the free-body diagram. This method is the same in one-, two-,
or three-dimensional systems. The only difference is that for the one-dimensional
case we have so far not included all forces in order to ensure the problem was indeed
one-dimensional. Now, we loosen that constraint and include all forces in the free-
body diagram.
Let us illustrate the main principles of the free-body diagram for a fully three-
dimensional problem by developing the free-body diagram of a car driving up a hill

Fig. 7.2 Illustration of a car driving up an inclined slope
as illustrated in Fig. 7.2a. We follow the enumerated steps from the general method,
while commenting on how it is applied.
1. Divide the problem into system and environment.
First, we define precisely what object we are studying the motion of—we discern
between the system and the environment. We find the forces acting on the system.
Everything that is not the system is the environment.
In this case the system is the car, and the environment is everything else, such as:
the ground, the Earth, and the air around the car.
7.1 Identifying Forces 185
The external forces may occur either at the contact between the car and the envi-
ronment. We call such forces contact forces. Or they may be long-range forces.
Typically, we find the contact forces first and leave the long-range forces to last.
We find the contact forces by addressing the physical processes occurring along the
external surface of the object:
2. Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object.
3. Draw a closed curve around the system.
4. Find contact points—these are the points where contact forces may act.
5. Give names and symbols to all the contact forces.
The car is in contact with the ground at the points where the four wheels are
touching the ground. We have already discussed the possible ambiguity of a contact
point. In many cases the contact is not in a point, but distributed over an area. However,
on a large scale, we can usually still represent the force as acting in a point.
What forces are acting in these points? Your answer to this question will depend
on your insight into and knowledge about force models—what kinds of macroscopic
forces are acting between objects.
Contact forces: Previously, we argued that we should separate the identification
of forces from the modeling of forces. Unfortunately, this is not really possible. In
practice, we cannot separate the two steps. As we identify forces acting on a body,
we are actually also identifying the interactions mechanisms, and we are already
making assumptions on how to model the interactions.
To make this rather abstract point more concrete, let us look at the example of the
car in detail. What forces are acting on the contact points between the car and the
ground?
As a first approximation, we could introduce a single force vector, the contact
force C, acting in the point of contact and having a component both normal to
the ground and along the ground as illustrated in Fig. 7.2b. While this is a correct
description—there is a force acting on the car from the ground, and it may have
components both normal and parallel to the ground—it is not a very useful way to
identify the forces. Why? Because we will not have a force model for this general
contact force. We could therefore introduce this general contact force here, but we
would need to decompose it into different physical models when we addressed how
to model this force.
Decomposing the contact force: Instead, what we mean when we say that we
identify the forces acting on the car in the contact point, is that we identify the different
force models, and that we introduce an individual force for each of the models. For
the contact between the ground and the car we could identify two different force
models: We recognize one force as due to the deformation of the wheel and the
ground. This is the normal force, N from the ground on the car as illustrated in
Fig. 7.2c. We recognize another force as due to the sticking or sliding of the wheel
relative to the ground. This is the friction force from the ground on the car, f. Notice
that when we identify forces, we are really identifying mechanisms or processes that
result in a force, which is the first step in identifying a model to describe the force.
186 7 Forces in Two and Three Dimensions
One or many contact forces: The contact forces from the ground on the car are
therefore the normal force, N, and the friction force, f. One force acts on each of the
four contact points of the car. We may represent each of these forces individually, or
we could instead describe the whole car as one block with only a single contact point
with the ground, and then represent the four contact forces only by a single force.
In this case we should redraw our figure so that there is only one contact point, as
shown in Fig. 7.2d, and only one normal force, N, and one friction force, f. Later on,
when we study the equilibrium of an object, we will see that we need to use more
than one contact point to determine if the car is rotating or not.
Choosing the direction of the vectors: We draw the normal force as a vector N
pointing upwards, since we expect this to be the direction of the force. If the y-axis is
the direction normal to the hill, as illustrated in Fig. 7.2d, the normal force is N = N j.
This simply means that if the normal force actually points in this direction, then N is
positive. Does it matter if we draw the vector in the “wrong direction”? What would
happen if we instead drew the normal force pointing downwards? In this case, we
would have N = N (−j), and a positive value of N would mean that the normal
force was acting downwards. We are therefore free to draw the vector in whatever
direction we want, the resulting numerical values for the components of the vector
will tell us in what direction the force is acting at a particular time. However, you
have to be consistent: When you have drawn the vector in a particular direction, you
need to stick to your choice.
Similarly, we draw a vector f pointing up along the hill to represent the friction
force. With the x-axis pointing up along the hill, this means that: f = f i. The friction
force may still act in the opposite direction for f < 0.
What other contact forces are acting on the car? The car is in contact with the
surrounding air. We should therefore also add a force due to air resistance on the car,
D, as illustrated in Fig. 7.2d.
6. Identify the long-range forces.
Finally, we find and draw the long-range forces acting on the car. The only long-
range force is gravity from the Earth, which acts on the car and point down towards
the center of the Earth. Gravity is drawn as the force G in Fig. 7.2d.
Now, the next two points in the general method are:
7. Make a drawing of the object. Draw the forces as arrows, vectors, starting where
the force is acting. The direction of the vector indicates the (positive) direction
of the force. Try to make the length of the arrow indicate the relative magnitude
of the forces.
8. Draw in the axes of the coordinate system. It is often convenient to make one axis
parallel to the direction of motion. When you choose direction of the axis you
also choose the positive direction for the axis.
When you are more experienced, you will probably follow the expert’s method
to find the free-body diagram, but you should not progress to this stage before you
7.1 Identifying Forces 187
have practiced the first method on several examples and found that it is too simple
and elaborate for your taste.
Expert’s method for drawing a free-body diagram: Follow these steps to
find, identify, and draw all the forces acting on an object in a free-body dia-
gram.
1. Identify the system, and make a drawing of the system. You may sketch the
environment in different colors or with a dotted line to help you.
2. Contact forces are acting at the contact points between the system and
the environment. Identify, name, and draw each contact force as a vector
starting at the point of contact.
3. Choose a coordinate system and draw the axes of the coordinate system
in the same figure as the system. It is often convenient to make one axis
parallel to the direction of motion.
7.2 Newton’s Second Law
We have already introduced Newton’s laws of motion on a vector form, therefore,
we do not need a new formulation for two- and three-dimensional problems.
Newton’s second law relates the acceleration of an object to the net force acting
on the object: ∑
j
Fext
j = ma , (7.1)
where the sum is over all the external forces acting on the system.
The external forces are exactly the forces you have included in the free-body diagram
of the object. Often we refer to the sum of all the external force as the net external
force:
Fnet = ∑
j
Fext
j . (7.2)
Inertial system: Newton’s second law is only valid in an inertial system. If the
references system is accelerated—either linearly or rotating—we cannot use New-
ton’s law.
Net external force: Newton’s second law is related to the net external force. External
forces are forces that have a cause outside the system, as we insisted on when you
188 7 Forces in Two and Three Dimensions
Fig. 7.3 A sphere is
hanging from two ropes that
are attached to the roof. In
this case, the net force is zero
even when none of the forces
point in the same direction,
as shown by the graphical
vector summation to the right
G
FA FB
G
FB
FA
drew the free-body diagram of the system. You can therefore not use the law for a
single force alone—it is the net force that is causing the acceleration of the object,
not one individual force acting on the system. For example, for the car driving up an
inclined slope discussed above, the net force on the car is:
Fnet = ∑
j
F j = N + f + D + G . (7.3)
Net force is a vector sum: The net force is a vector sum of all the external forces.
Notice that the net force can be zero even if none of the force vectors point in the
same direction, as illustrated in Fig. 7.3.
Vector equation: Newton’s second law is a vector equation. This means that it is
valid for each of the vector components independently:
∑
j
Fext
j = ma , (7.4)
implies that:
∑
j
Fext
j,x = ma x , ∑
j
Fext
j,y = ma y , ∑
j
Fext
j,z = ma z , (7.5)
where F j,x = F j · i and a x = a · i, and similarly for the other two components.
We can decompose Newton’s law along any set of axes we like. We will see that
it is often useful to choose the axes wisely, for example by ensuring that the net force
along one of the axis direction is zero, so that there is no change in motion in this
direction.
Notice that this means that the object can be accelerated in the x-direction, if the
net force in this direction is non-zero, while it moves with constant velocity in the
7.2 Newton’s Second Law 189
y-direction, if the net force in this direction is zero. The behavior along orthogonal
axes can therefore be completely decoupled.
Superposition principle: Forces are subject to the superposition principle. We can
add together or decompose forces as we like. This allows us to subdivide a force,
such as the surface interaction force, f, for the car driving up the hill, into several
forces, each representing a specific surface interaction term:
f = ffriction + fadhesion + flubrication + . . . . (7.6)
7.3 Force Model—Constant Gravity
According to Newton’s law of gravity, there is a gravitational force between any
two objects with gravitational masses. For an object close to the Earth’s surface, the
gravitational force on the object can be approximated as:
G = −mg j , (7.7)
where m is the gravitational mass of the object, g is the acceleration of gravity, and
the unit vector j points upwards. Upwards is indeed usually defined based on the
direction of the force from gravitation. This constant gravity force model is valid as
long as the object does not move far away from the surface of the Earth, and as long
as the object does not move too far along the surface of the Earth, since this would
lead to a change in the unit vector j.
We notice that this force model is particularly simple: The force on an object
due to gravity is a constant— both in magnitude and direction. Our discussion of
the constant gravity force model may be extended to any constant force, such as the
force on a charged particle in a homogeneous electric field.
If you throw a ball from the ground, the only forces acting on the ball after it has
left your hand are the force from gravity, G, and air resistance, D. It we neglect the
effect of air resistance, the only force acting on the ball is gravity. We can therefore
apply Newton’s second law to find the acceleration of the ball:
∑
j
F j = G = mg j = ma ⇒ a = −g j . (7.8)
Since we have wisely chosen the y-axis to correspond to the direction of gravity,
the acceleration of the ball is non-zero only in y-direction. The acceleration in the
x- and z-directions are zero, and the velocities in these directions do therefore not
change. We call such a motion decoupled because the motion in the x- and y-axes are
independent of each other. We will use this when we solve problems with constant
forces.

ball thrown across the lecture
room
7.3.1 Example: Motion of a Ball with Gravity
Throughout this chapter we will follow a particular problem as we gradually increase
the complexity of the physical model: The motion of a ball thrown across the class-
room. The experiment is illustrated in Fig. 7.4, which illustrates the observed path of
a ball in an experiment. How can we develop a realistic model for the motion of this
ball? We start from the simplest description: The motion when affected by gravity
alone.
Problem: A ball is thrown from a height h above the ground at an angle α with the
horizontal with an initial speed v0 . Find the velocity and position of the ball at a
time t.
Identify and Sketch: In this exercise we address the motion of the ball, described by
the position r(t) as a function of time. At the time t0 , the ball was thrown. We place
the coordinate system so that gravity is acting in the y-direction, and we place the
x-axis so that the ball is thrown in the positive x-direction. The origin is placed at the
ground, directly below the initial position of the ball at t = t0 . The initial position
vector is therefore r(t0) = r0 = h j. The initial velocity is directed at an angle α with
the horizontal, this means that the initial velocity is v(t0) = v0 cos(α) i + v0 sin(α) j.
The situation is illustrated in Fig. 7.5.

7.3 Force Model—Constant Gravity 191
Model: The motion of the ball is determined by the forces acting on it. The only
contact force acting on the ball is air resistance, FD , but we will here assume that
this force is negligible. The only long-distance force acting on the ball is gravity, G,
as illustrated in the free-body diagram in Fig. 7.5.
Newton’s second law is applied to both the x- and the y-component of the forces
independently. In the x-direction Newton’s second law gives:
∑ Fx = ma x = 0 . (7.9)
There are no horizontal forces. The sum of the forces in the horizontal, x-direction
is therefore zero. Consequently, the acceleration in the x-direction, a x is also zero.
Newton’s law of motion in the y-direction gives:
∑ F y = G = −mg = ma y , (7.10)
where we have used that the gravitational force from the Earth is mg, and that it acts
in the negative y-direction.
The acceleration of the ball is therefore:
a = d2r
dt2 = −g j , (7.11)
and the initial conditions are r(t0) = h j and v(t0) = v0 .
Solve: We find the motion of the ball by solving the differential equation in (7.11).
Since the acceleration is constant, we can solve it by direct integration for each of
the components.
In the x-direction, the acceleration is zero, and the velocity in this direction is
therefore constant.
v x (t) = v x (t0) = v0 cos(α) . (7.12)

v0,y = v0 sin(α):

which gives
y(t) = h + v0 sin(α)(t − t0) − 1
2 g(t − t0)2 , (7.25)
where y(t0) = h is the launch height of the projectile.
Analyze: We notice that the motion in the x- and y-directions are independent of
each other. The motion in the x-direction is simply a motion with constant velocity.
The motion in the y-direction is the same as for the one-dimensional problem. If the
ground is flat, it is the motion in the y-direction that determines how long time it
takes to reach the ground. We can therefore answer questions about flight time, and
maximum height by just studying the one-dimensional motion along the y-direction.
We have now found the complete solution for the motion of a ball subject only to
gravity. From this solution, we can answer any complicated question, such as how
far the projectile travels or what choise of initial direction gives the maximum length.
7.4 Force Model—Viscous Force
For an object moving through a fluid, such as a projectile flying through the air,
a meteor entering the Earth’s atmosphere, or a tiny microrobot navigating through
your bloodstream, there is a contact force on the object due to the motion of the
7.4 Force Model—Viscous Force 193
object relative to the fluid. The fluid has to flow around the object when the object
moves, as a result the fluid exerts a force on the object. This force is distributed: It
acts everywhere on the surface of the object, and it may also vary in magnitude and
direction along the surface of the object. Usually, we will simplify the effect of the
this distribution of forces into a single force acting in a single point on the object, and
we will call this force the drag force or the “fluid resistance” acting on the object.
For most purposes this is a sufficiently precise description of the interaction with the
fluid.
The form of the drag force depends on the velocity of the object relative to the fluid.
We discern between a behavior at low velocities, where the drag force is proportional
to the velocity, and high velocities, where the drag force depends on the square of
the velocity:
The drag force on an object moving at a velocity v relative to a fluid moving
with a velocity w is:
FD 
{ −k v (v − w) at small velocities
−D |v − w| (v − w) at high velocities (7.26)
The constant k v depends on the object’s size, shape and surface, as well as on the
(dynamic) viscosity of the fluid. For a sphere Stokes found that
k v = 6π R η (7.27)
where R is the radius of the sphere, and η is the viscosity of the fluid. The viscosity
of air is η = 1.82 × 10−5 Nsm−2 and for water it is η = 1.00 × 10−3 Nsm−2 , both
at room temperature.
Experimental data indicates an approximative value for D for a spherical object:
D  12.0 ρ R2 . (7.28)
where v = |v|, ρ is the density of the fluid, and R is the radius of the sphere.
Versatility of the viscous force model: The viscous force model
FD = −k vv , (7.29)
is much more versatile than suggested by its application to fluid drag forces. It is often
used as a general damping term—a term reducing relative motion that also introduces
dissipation and heat generation. For example, you will find that the viscous force
model used to model damping of vibrations in solid object, to model the damping
of vibrations in macroscopic objects and macroscopic springs, and to model surface
forces in nano-scale surface contact. The viscous force model is a first order model
to study any velocity-dependent force that tends to reduce velocity differences.

7.4.1 Example: Path Through a Tornado
You are part of a tornado-chaser team—a group of scientists trying to discover the
inner workings of tornadoes. An important part of this work is to develop methods to
measure the pressure and wind velocity inside the tornado. Your plan is to use many
tiny projectiles with small accelerometers inside. You plan to shoot the projectiles
through the tornado, pick them up afterwards, and read the recorded accelerations.
Here, we will assume that the accelerometers record the acceleration in the x, y, and
z-direction during flight. Here, we will develop a model for the flight of the projectile,
and calculate realistic trajectories in order to learn how to launch the projectiles.
Sketch and Identify: Our task is to determine the motion of a projectile, character-
ized by its position r(t). For the calculations, we use a coordinate system with the
origin in the center of the tornado at ground level. The z-axis points in the vertical
direction, with the positive direction upwards. We will launch the projectile from the
position r(t0) = r0 with an initial velocity, v(t0) = v0 at t0 = 0.0 s.
Model: While the projectile is in the air, the only contact force affecting the object
is the force from the surrounding air, FD , in addition to gravity, G, as illustrated in
Fig. 7.6.
Since the projectile will be moving fast, we use the square-law force model for the
air resistance. However, in this case it is important to realize that the force depends
on the velocity of the projectile, v, relative to the velocity of the wind, u(r). The
square-law force model is therefore:
FD = −D (v − u) |v − u| , (7.30)
where for a spherical object we have that the prefactor is D  3.0ρd2 , where d is
the diameter of the sphere and ρ is the density of the surrounding air. Here, we will
assume that the density of the surrounding air does not change significantly, and we

will use ρ = 1.293 k/m 3 . Let us also assume that the projectile has a diameter of
d = 0.02 m, and that its mass is m = 0.1 kg.
The force from gravity is G = −mg k, where k is the unit vector in the z-direction.
Newton’s second law: Newton’s second law gives the acceleration of the projectile:
ma = ∑
j
F j = FD + G . (7.31)
The acceleration is therefore:
a = − D
m (v − u) |v − u| − g k . (7.32)
and the initial conditions are r(t0) = r0 and v(t0) = v0 .
Model of wind velocity: However, in order to test and analyze the path of the
projectile, we need a model for the velocity u in the tornado. Since we do not know
this velocity-field, we will here use a model for the velocity taken from an analoguous
situation. We can make an experimental tornado by rotating a thin cylinder in a fluid.
For this case, we know that the velocity in the fluid will have the form:
u(r) = u(r) ˆuθ , (7.33)
where the center of the cylinder is at the origin, and the speed, u(r), depends only
on the distance to the center of the cylinder, and the unit vector ˆuθ points in the
tangential direction, as illustrated in Fig. 7.6. The speed u(r) has the following form:
u(r) =
{ u0 (r∗/r) for r > r∗
u0 (r/r∗) for r < r∗ , (7.34)
where r∗ is the radius of the cylinder.
We use this as a model for the velocity field inside the tornado to estimate the path
of the projectile. Let us assume that we study a tornado with a radius of r∗ = 10 m,
and with a maximum wind speed of u0 = 50.0 m/s, which corresponds to a category
F1 tornado.
Numerical solution: We can now use our theoretical model to find the motion of the
projectile. We use a Euler-Cromer method to find the velocity and position vectors
as function of time, starting from t = t0 , and continuing until the projectile hits the
ground.
Euler-Cromer’s method consists of the following steps:
v(t0 + Δt)  v(t0) + Δt a(t0, r(t0), v(t0)) (7.35)
r(t0 + Δt)  r(t0) + Δt v(t0 + Δt) . (7.36)
196 7 Forces in Two and Three Dimensions
This method is implemented in the following program:

u = U*array([-r[i,1]/rr,r[i,0]/rr,0.0])
vrel = v[i] - u
aa = -g - Dm*norm(vrel)*vrel
a[i] = aa

r[i+1] = r[i] + dt*v[i+1]
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
i = i + 1
imax = i
ii = r_[1:imax]
Notice how we have used that the tangential vector to a point at (x, y) points in the
direction (−y/r, x/r), where r2 = x2 + y2 .
Analysis: We now have a tool to start addressing the motion of the projectile inside
the tornado. Let us use this to test the path of a projectile launched from a distance
of 100 m towards the center of the tornado with an initial speed v = 100 m/s.
Since the tornado is symmetric, we launch the projectile from the position
r0 = −100 m i. We fire the projectile at an angle of 45◦ with the horizon, which
corresponds to an angle of π/4 in radians, since this gives the maximum length when
there is no air-resistance. The initial velocity is therefore v0 = 100 m/s cos(π/4) i
+100 m/s sin(π/4) j. The resulting path is shown in Fig. 7.7.
The trajectory is hardly affected by the tornado. How can we change the trajectory
to make it more sensitive to the wind speed? We could shoot it at an angle with the
center, and not directly towards the center. This is attempted by introducing the angle
θ, which gives the deviation from the line straight into the center. The initial velocity
is now.

Simulations for various values of θ are given in Fig. 7.7.
Notice the change in trajectories for the various angles. The next step would be
to see how easy it would be to find the velocity field from these trajectories or from
a set of trajectories, but we will not pursue this direction here. From our discussion
you should be able to see how we can use this model to address how to launch the
projectile.
Test your understanding: Based on this analysis, would you recommend launching the projectile
by shooting it into the tornado, or by ejecting them vertically as the tornado is passing from a
container ledged to the ground?
7.5 Force Model—Spring Force
When we introduced the spring model in one dimension, it was used to represent
two different concepts:
• To model the force from a linearly elastic spring
• To represent the simplest position-dependent force model
Both of these interpretations are still important in two- and three-dimensional sys-
tems. We may use a spring model as a model for deformation, and we may use the
spring model as a simplified model for a position-dependent force. However, we
have more degrees of freedom, and we can therefore define a spring model in several
different ways.
198 7 Forces in Two and Three Dimensions
Full Spring Model
Let us first see how the force due the deformation of a spring can be generalized in
two- and three-dimensions. From one-dimensional experiments, we expect the force
from a spring on the object attached to the spring to depend on the elongation of the
spring and act in the direction of the spring. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 7.8. A
spring is characterized by its equilibrium length, L0 , and its spring constant, k. The
force from the spring on the object is:
F = −k (L − L0) ˆu r , (7.38)
where L is the length of the spring, and the unit vector ˆu r points from the spring
towards the object. (Check for yourself that the sign is indeed correct). If the object
is located at the position r, and the other end of the spring is attached to the point R,
as in Fig. 7.8, the length of the spring is:
L = |r − R| , (7.39)
and the unit vector pointing from R toward r is:
ˆu r = r − R
|r − R| . (7.40)

7.5 Force Model—Spring Force 199
In the full spring model, the force from a spring attached to one end at R and
at the other end to an object at r is:
F = −k (L − L0) ˆu r , (7.41)
where L = |r − R| is the length of the spring, and L0 is the equilibrium length
of the spring.
Often, we will place the origin at the attachment point of the spring, so that R = 0,
and the full model simplifies to:
F = −k (r − L0) r
r , (7.42)
where the length of the spring, L = r = |r|, is the distance from the origin to the
particle.
We have named this model the “full model” because it most closely represents
the behavior of a real, physical spring. This force model is versatile and general and
can be widely applied. For example, it can be used to model the deformation of an
elastic body, or the force between two atoms in a molecule. This model will be our
preferred model for contact forces such as forces due to deformation in two- and
three-dimensional systems.
Notice that the force model has a spherical symmetry: When we choose the origin
at the attachment point (R = 0), the force from the spring on the attached object
always acts along a line through the origin, and the magnitude of the force depends
on the distance r to the origin. This means that force on the particle from the spring
in the x-direction is:
Fx = −k (r − L0) x
r = −k
(√
x2 + y2 + z2 − L0
) x
√x2 + y2 + z2 . (7.43)
That is, the force in the x-direction, depends not only on the x-position, but also
on the y and z coordinates. If we apply Newton’s second law of motion to such a
system, the acceleration of the object in the x-direction, will depend on the x, y, and
z coordinates of the object: We call such a system coupled, and notice that it may
not be that simple to find the solution to the equations of motion in this case.
Lattice Spring Model
While the full spring model has a simple physical interpretation—it models the
behavior of a physical spring—the resulting equations of motion are not that simple
200 7 Forces in Two and Three Dimensions
Fig. 7.9 An atom in a lattice

from a mathematical point of view, because the motion in the x, y, and z-directions are
coupled. It is therefore common to introduce a decoupled spring model. The physical
analogue of a decoupled system is found in a crystalline lattice: A central atom is
attached with linear springs to four neighboring atoms, as illustrated in Fig. 7.9. Let
us assume that the neighboring atoms do not move.
In the lattice spring model, the force on an object attached with springs in all
directions is:
F = −k x (x − x e) i − k y (y − ye) j , (7.44)
where x e and ye is the position of the atom when it is in equilibrium, and k x
and k y are the spring constants in the x- and y-directions respectively. This
model is often referred to as the harmonic oscillator model .
In this model, the forces in the x- and y-directions are independent of each other,
which also means that the motion in the x- and y-directions are decoupled. For
example, if the atom is only affected by the lattice spring force, Newton’s second
law gives:
∑ F = k x (x − x e) i + k y (y − ye) j = m (a x i + a y j) (7.45)
equating the components on each side therefore gives two, independent equations of
motion for motion along the x- and y-axes:
k x (x − x e) = ma x , k y (y − ye) = ma y (7.46)
This problem is mathematically much simpler than the full model: We can simply
use the results we already found in the one-dimensional case.
7.5 Force Model—Spring Force 201
7.5.1 Example: Motion of a Bouncing Ball with Air Resistance
In this example we study the motion of an object subject to a constant force, a velocity-
dependent force, and a position-dependent force. We solve the problem numerically
and discuss the results following a workflow similar to what you will find in many
practical problems.
Let us continue to refine the description of a ball thrown in the classroom. So far
we have introduced gravity and air resistance. But what happens when the ball hits
the floor? We need to also include a force model for the normal force from the floor
on the ball. The simplest approach to such a contact force model is a spring model:
We model the interaction between the floor and the ball as a single spring. But the
normal force is zero when there is no contact. In this problem we demonstrate how
to include such effects in our models.
Problem: A ball is thrown from a height h above the ground with an initial velocity
v0 . Find the velocity and position of the ball as a function of time t. Include the
normal force from the floor while the ball is in contact with the floor.
Identify and Sketch: We describe the position of the ball by r(t), measured in a
coordinate system with origin at the floor. The initial position and velocity of the
projectile is r(t0) = h j and v(t0) = v0 = v x,0 i + v y,0 j.
Model: The motion of the ball is determined by the forces acting: air resistance,
FD , the normal force N from the floor, and gravity, G = −mg j, as illustrated in the
free-body diagram in Fig. 7.10. We use a square law for air resistance:
FD = −Dvv . (7.47)
The normal force from the floor on the ball is represented by a spring force. This
is a strong simplification of the actual deformation process occurring at the contact
between the ball and the floor due to the deformation of both the ball and the floor.

202 7 Forces in Two and Three Dimensions
The deformed region corresponds roughly to the region of “overlap” between the
ball and the floor in Fig. 7.10. The depth of this region is Δy = R − y(t), where R
is the radius of the ball, which corresponds to the compression ΔL of the spring:
N = −k (R − y(t)) j . (7.48)
We check that the sign is correct: The normal force must act upward when y < R,
hence the sign must be negative.
However, we must also ensure that the normal force only acts when the ball is in
contact with the floor, otherwise the normal force is zero. The full formation of the
normal force is therefore:
N =
{ −k (R − y(t)) j when y(t) < R
0 when y(t) ≥ R . (7.49)
Newton’s second law: Newton’s second law is now
∑

F j = G + FD + N = ma , (7.50)
which gives
a = − (D/m) v v − g j + N/m , (7.51)
with the initial conditions: r(t0) = r(0 s) = r0 and v(t0) = v(0 s) = v0 . While it
is difficult to determine the motion analytically, we may be able to find analytical
solutions for parts of the motion. However, we can determine the motion numerically
by integrating (7.51) using Euler-Cromer’s method:
v(ti + Δt)  v(ti ) + Δt a(ti , r(ti ), v(ti )) (7.52)
r(ti + Δt)  r(ti ) + Δt v(ti + Δt) . (7.53)

where we have used the v T = 10.0 m/s to calculate D, and m = 0.2 kg. We have
chosen to use the spring constant k = 1000 N/m, a number we have largely guessed
for now. (The effective spring constant may be measured by experiment or calculated
if we know the material properties of the ball and the floor). The resulting path is
illustrated in Fig. 7.11, where it is compared with the path of the ball without air
resistance.
Detailed analysis of wall contact: While the behavior in Fig. 7.11 looks reasonable
at first, a closer examination shows that something is wrong, at least according to our
intuition. When there is no air resistance, the ball bounces back to the same height!
We know that a real ball would not behave like this. What is wrong?
Figure 7.12 shows a magnification of the behavior of the ball during a bounce
when there is no air resistance. The red lines in the figures mark the positions and
the times when the ball comes in contact with the floor. We see that the horizontal
velocity, v x , does not change at all during the bounce. This is not surprising, since
the normal force only has a vertical component. No horizontal forces means no
horizontal acceleration. However, we also see that the vertical velocity component,
v y , simply reverses during the bounce. This is the part that strikes us as unrealistic.
And indeed it is. How can we modify the force model for the normal force to ensure
that the vertical speed is smaller after the collision? This question we will return to
later when we discuss energy and collisions. The short answer is that we need to
introduce a force that is velocity dependent: Any force model that only depends on

The red lines illustrates the points where the ball comes in contact with the floor
the vertical position y(t) of the ball will always result in a reversal of the velocity!
By introducing a viscous force, a linear velocity dependent force model, during the
collision with the floor, the outgoing vertical velocity will be reduced. But more on
this later! (See Chap. 12.)
Comments: We have now built a model for a bouncing ball, including both air
resistance and a normal force from the floor. You should notice the simple structure
followed systematically: as long as we can develop force models for the interactions,
we can model the motion. This method is robust and no different in one-, two-, or three
dimensions. You should also notice that the normal force changes: It does not always
just balance the gravitational force—it is indeed larger than the gravitational force
in parts of the collision. Otherwise the normal force would not be able to change the
direction of the ball. This simple point is a clear result of the force model approach,
and also of a careful physical analysis, but represents a classical misunderstanding.
7.6 Force Model—Central Force 205
7.6 Force Model—Central Force
The long-distance forces of gravitation and the electrostatic interaction (Coulomb’s
law) are examples of central forces: A force between two objects that:
• acts in the center of the objects
• acts along a line connecting the two objects
• depends on the distance between the two objects
A central force has the form:
F = F(r) r
r = F(r) ˆu r , (7.54)
where the magnitude F(r) of the force is a function of the distance r only.
Both gravitation and the electrostatic force has the same form for the central force,
the inverse square law:
F = C
r2 ˆu r = C r
r3 . (7.55)
where for C = −Gm M this corresponds to Newton’s law of gravitation.
The central force model is a force between two objects, where we have placed
one of the objects in the origin, and we are only interested in the motion of the other
object. This corresponds to the case where the object in the origin is very massive,
so that it does not move significantly, or where it is in some way attached, so that it
does not move.
Notice that the full spring model also is a central force model, but it does not
display the inverse square law. We can use the central force model to describe not
only gravitation and electrostatic interactions, but also for many interatomic forces,
and as we have seen, for spring forces.
7.6.1 Example: Comet Trajectory
A comet of mass m is affected by the gravitational force from the Sun
F(r) = −G m M r
r3 , (7.56)
where r is the position of the comet in a coordinate system centered on the Sun.
We assume that the Sun does not move. How can we find the motion of the comet?

Sketch: We start from a simple sketch of the system. The comet starts at r = Ri,
with an initial velocity v0 . But we do not still know how it will move, so we have
only made a guess for its trajectory. We have also added the coordinate system in the
center of the Sun.
Newton’s second law: Newton’s second law gives us the acceleration of the comet:
ma = −G m M r
r3 ⇒ a = −G M r
r3 , (7.57)
which is independent of the mass of the comet. The trajectory of a small comet and
a large planet will therefore be the same with the same initial conditions.
Integration of motion: We find the motion of the comet by solving (7.57) numeri-
cally. Generally, this problem requires a more advanced numerical solution method
in order to avoid inaccuracies—you should use a fourth order Runge-Kutta with
adaptive time step—but we will here employ the Euler-Cromer scheme with a very
small time step because of its transparent implementation.
The Euler-Cromer scheme allows us to find the velocity and time after a small
time-step Δt, starting from the initial condition at time t = t0 :
v(t0 + Δt)  v(t0) + Δt a(t0, r(t0), v(t0)) (7.58)
r(t0 + Δt)  r(t0) + Δt v(t0 + Δt) . (7.59)
We use realistic numbers for the masses of the Sun, and choose the initial radius R
and the initial velocity to correspond to that of the Earth: v0 : M = 1.99 × 10 30 kg,
R = 1.5×10 11 m, v0 = 3×10 4 m/s, and G = 6.673×10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 . We choose
the direction of the initial velocity to be along the y-axis. The implementation is then
straight-forward:
from pylab import *
# Physical values
M = 1.99e30 # kg
R = 2e11 # m
v0mag = 3e4 # m/s
G = 6.673e-11 # mˆ3\,kgˆ-1 sˆ-2

Analysis: The resulting trajectory in Fig. 7.14 shows that the comet is moving in a
circular orbit! What happens if we change the initial conditions a bit? If we reduce
the initial velocity by a factor 3, the resulting trajectory is no longer a circle, but
looks more like an ellipse. What if we increase the initial velocity by a factor 1.5?
Then the resulting trajectory is no longer a closed loop—the comet leaves the solar
system!
You will learn more about planetary motion later on. For now we realize that we
can calculate the motion of planet using Newton’s second law and the gravitational
force model.

Summary
Newton’s second law:
• Newton’s second law relates the acceleration of an object to the net forces acting
on it: ∑
j F j = ma, where the sum is over all forces acting on the object, and m
is the inertial mass.
• All forces acting on a system has a source in the environment.
• Forces can be contact forces acting on the boundary between the system and the
environment.
• Forces can be long range forces from an object in the environment.
• Forces are drawn as vectors starting at the point where the force is acting, pointing
in the direction of the force, and with a length indicating the length of the force.
• The force may be a given quantity, F.
• The gravitational force acts between all objects. On the surface of the Earth the
gravitational force on an object is W = −mg j, where j is a unit vector pointing
upwards, g is the acceleration of gravity, and m is the gravitational mass. The
gravitational mass is equal to the inertial mass.
• The contact force from a fluid on a moving object depends on the velocity of
the object relative to the fluid. The simplest force model is the viscous force,
D = −k vv, where the constant k v depends on the viscosity of the fluid and the size
of the object.
• The contact force from a solid depends on the distance between the object and the
solid. The simplest force model that depends on the position of an object is the
independent spring force model: F = −k x (x − x e) i − k y (y − ye) j − k z (z − z e) k.
Here, x e, ye, z e are equilibrium positions in the x, y, and z-directions, and k x , k y ,
and k z are spring constants. The spring model is one of the most fundamental force
models because it is the first order Taylor expansion of any position-dependent
force.
Problem-solving approach:
• We identify the object and its initial conditions.
• We model the behavior by find the forces acting on the object, introducing force
models for all the forces, and applying Newton’s second law to find an equation
for the acceleration of the object.
• We solve the problem by finding the position and velocity from the acceleration
and the initial conditions using numerical or analytical techniques.
• We analyze the solution to validate it, and use the solution to answer the original
question posed.

Projects
7.17 Ball in a spring. In this project you will study an advanced model of a pendu-
lum. The pendulum consists of a ball in a massless rope moving in a vertical plane.
The ball has mass m. You can neglect air resistance. We describe the position of the
ball by the position vector, r = x i + y j. In this project we will introduce a model for
the pendulum by assuming that the rope can be modelled as a spring with a spring
constant k and an equilibrium length L0 .
(a) Identify the forces and draw a free-body diagram of the ball.
(b) Show that the net external force acting on the ball can be written as:
∑
j
F = −mg j − k (r − L0) r
r , (7.60)
where r = |r| is the length of the (stretched) rope, and the origin of the coordinate
system is chosen to be the attachment point, O, of the rope.
(c) Rewrite the expression of the external force on component form by writing the
force components, Fx , and F y , as functions of the components x and y of the position
vector, r(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j.
In this project, we will not assume that the ball is following a particular path, such
as a circle, but we will instead use Newton’s second law to determine the motion of
the ball from the forces acting on it. Using our model, we can measure the tension
in the rope, as well as the motion of the ball, and analyze these to learn about the
motion.
(d) For a pendulum, it is customary to describe the position of the pendulum by its
angle θ with the vertical. Does the angle θ give a sufficient description of the position
of the ball in this case? Explain your answer.
(e) If the ball is at rest at θ = 0 with no velocity (v = 0) and no acceleration, what
is the position of the ball? What happens if you increase the value of k for the rope?
We will now study a specific pendulum, consisting of a ball with a mass of 0.1 kg,
and a rope of equilibrium length L0 = 1 m with a spring constant k = 200 N/m,
which corresponds to a rather elastic rope. Initially, you can assume that the ball starts
212 7 Forces in Two and Three Dimensions
with zero velocity at an angle θ = 30◦ at a distance L0 from the origin. We want to
study the motion of the ball by integrating the equations of motion numerically.
(f) Find an expression for the acceleration, a, of the ball. You should write it both
on vector form, where there acceleration vector is a function of the position vector
r and its length, r, and on component form, where the components a x and a y are
functions of the x and y components of the position vector.
(g) What is the mathematical initial value problem you need to solve in order to find
the motion of the ball? Include both the differential equation you need to solve and
the initial conditions in your answer.
(h) How can you solve this problem numerically? Write down a set of equations
that find the position and velocity at a time t + Δt given the position and velocity
at t using Euler-Cromer’s method. Insert your expression for the acceleration from
above. Mark the terms in your equations that vary in time.
(i) Write a program that “solves” the problem by finding the motion of the ball.
The program should plot the position of the ball in the x y-plane for the first 10 s of
the motion. Hint 1: You may write the mathematical expression almost directly into
your program if you use a vector notation and vector operations in your code. Hint 2:
Remember that r = r(t) = |r(t)| varies in time! Hint 3: Do not use θ(t) to describe
the position of the ball. Describe the motion using r(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j and use your
results from above for the acceleration.
(j) Use the program to find the behavior for the given initial conditions using a
time-step of Δt = 0.001. Plot the resulting motion. Describe what you see.
(k) What happens if you increase Δt to Δt = 0.01 and Δt = 0.1? Can you explain
this? Test what happens if you use Euler’s method with Δt = 0.001 instead of
Euler-Cromer’s method.
(l) Rerun the program with k = 20 and k = 2000. Describe the motion in these cases
and compare with k = 200 case. Are your results reasonable? Based on this, can
you suggest how to use this method to model a pendulum in a stiff rope? What do
you think would be the limitation of this approach? (Test what happens if you use
k = 2 10 6 in your program).
(m) Rewrite your program to ensure that the rope tension is zero if the spring is com-
pressed, because the rope cannot sustain compression. Use this program to determine
the motion with the initial conditions v0 = 6.0 m/s i and r0 = −L0 j. What happens?
7.18 Weather balloon. In this project we will develop a model to determine the
motion of a weather balloon released from the ground. We start from a simplified
model and gradually add features to make to model more realistic.
After the balloon is released, it is driven by buoyancy. Initially, we will assume
that the buoyancy force is a constant, B.
(a) Draw a free-body diagram of the balloon. Identify the forces and introduce sym-
bols. Indicate the relative magnitudes of the forces by the length of the vectors.
First, let us neglect air resistance.
(b) What is the acceleration of the balloon?
(c) Find the position and velocity of the balloon as a function of time.
Let us now introduce air resistance, using a quadratic law: FD = −D v v.

(k) We can determine the motion of the balloon using numerical methods. Write
a program to find the velocity v(t) and position r(t) as functions of time. (It is
sufficient to only include the main integration step in your answer - that is the part
that determines v(t + Δt) and r(t + Δt) given v(t) and r(t).
Figure 7.16 shows the result of a simulation.
(l) Describe the motion of the balloon. Illustrate by relevant sketches.
(m) Find the asymptotic (terminal) velocity of the balloon.
In a real situation, the wind velocity is smaller near the ground and increases
gradually to the full velocity w0 as the balloon moves upward. Typically, the velocity
of the wind can be described by w = w0 (1 − exp(−z/d)) i, where d = 10 m is a
length determining the transition.
(n) Rewrite your program to include this effect.
(o) What is the terminal velocity of the balloon now?
Chapter 8
Constrained Motion
In many cases, the object we are studying is not free to move in every direction. For
example, a bead on a wire can only move along the wire. The shape and position of
the wire determine the path of the bead, but the bead is still free to move in many
different ways along that wire. In this case we call the motion “constrained”. The
constraints can be strong, by restricting the motion to be along a given path, or the
constraints can be weak, such as for a bead caught between two parallel glass plates,
or for a car driving on the terrain. Constraints may also arise because objects are
connected to each other: The motion of an individual atom in a large rigid molecule
is constrained by the motion of the whole molecule, and a small part of a spinning
wheel is constrained to follow the motion of the wheel.
We have learned that the motion of an object can be determined from the forces
acting on the object. This is, of course, also the case for constrained motion. But
in many cases it is not practical to include the forces that restrict the motion, either
because we do not have good models for them, or because we would rather like to
determine these constraining forces from what we know about the motion—from
the fact that the object follows a particular path. For example, a bead moving along
a wire will be affected by normal forces from the wire on the bead, and it is these
forces that cause the bead to follow the path given by the wire. However, we may not
want to model these forces in detail, instead we are interested in the consequences of
constraints—we want to find the normal force when we know that the bead follows
the wire.
In this chapter, we will discuss constrained motion. Starting from the simplest
case of motion constrained to a line, through circular motion, to motion constrained
to be along a general curve.
8.1 Linear Motion
The simplest case of a constrained motion is that of a bead moving along a straight,
rigid wire (see Fig. 8.1) or a car moving along a straight road. We call such a motion
linearly constrained—because the motion is constrained to follow a given line.

Fig. 8.1 a The motion of a bead moving along a straight wire is constrained to be along the line
described by the wire. b The motion of a small train moving up along an inclined track is also
constrained by the track. The motion can be described both in a coordinate system with axes along
the track, and in a coordinate system with axis in the horizontal and vertical direction
How can we formulate a mathematical constraint corresponding to the motion of a
bead on a wire as in Fig. 8.1? The simplest way is to choose the x-axis to be along the
wire. Then the bead can only move along the x-axis, and the y-, and z-components
remain zero throughout the motion:
r(t) = x(t) i + 0 j + 0 k = x(t) i . (8.1)
Because we are free to choose the coordinate system, we can always make such a
choice for linear motion.
We can also formulate the constraint without fixing the x-axis to be along the
direction of motion, such as for the train in Fig. 8.1. The train moves along a slope
that forms the angle θ with the horizon. We can describe the slope by the point R
and the unit vector ˆu = cos θ i + sin θ j which points along the slope. The position
of the train is then given by how far along the slope it has moved, s(t):
r(t) = R + ˆu s(t) . (8.2)
We call s(t) the distance, and notice that it would correspond to the coordinate x′ of
a coordinate system oriented along the slope. Since R is a constant, the velocity of
the train is
dr
dt = dR
dt︸︷︷︸
=0
+ ˆu ds
dt = ˆu ds
dt , (8.3)
where ds/dt is the velocity measured along the track, which is what you would
measure from a speedometer. The distance s(t) traveled reflects the motion of the
bead. It does not have to be only increasing, but may reflect a complicated motion
along the wire.
8.2 Curved Motion 217
8.2 Curved Motion
We can use the insight from motion along a straight wire to understand curved
motion, such as the circular motion of an atom in a rotating, rigid molecule or the
motion of a roller-coaster car following its track.
Position
For a train running along a track as illustrated in Fig. 8.2 we can use the same
description as we used above: We describe the position, r(s(t)), of the train by the
distance, s(t), travelled along the track. In Fig. 8.2 the train moves with constant
speed along the track. A sequence of times at constant intervals, ti = iΔT , as shown
with circles.

218 8 Constrained Motion
Velocity Vector
What is the velocity of the train? The velocity vector is the time derivative of the
position vector:
v = dr
dt = lim
Δt→0
r(t + Δt) − r(t)
Δt = lim
Δt→0
Δr
Δt . (8.4)
We see from Fig. 8.2c that as the time interval Δt decreases, the displacement Δr
becomes tangential to the curve, just as we found in Chap. 6:
v(t) = v(t) ˆu T , (8.5)
where ˆu T (t) is the unit tangent vector, ˆu T = v/|v|. We also see that as Δt becomes
small, the arc length along the curve, Δs becomes approximately the same as the
displacement Δr = |Δr|:
Δr → Δs when Δt → 0 . (8.6)
The magnitude of the velocity therefore approaches
v = |Δr|
Δt = Δr
Δt → Δs
Δt → ds
dt . (8.7)
when Δt → 0. Now, we know both the direction and the magnitude of the velocity:
Velocity of motion along a curve:
v(t) = v(t) ˆu T (t) = ds
dt ˆu T (t) . (8.8)
Notice that the unit vector ˆu T is not a constant, but changes with time as the
object moves: ˆu T = ˆu T (t).
Acceleration Vector
The acceleration of the train can be found by taking the time derivative of the velocity
vector:
a = d
dt v(t) ˆu T (t) = dv
dt ˆu T + v(t) d ˆu T
dt . (8.9)
We recognize the first component as the rate of change of the magnitude of the
velocity—this is how the speedometer changes as the train accelerates.
8.2 Curved Motion 219
What about the second term? We have illustrated a small part of a motion in
Fig. 8.2d. We are interested in the change in the tangent vector from the point A at
r(t) to the point A′ at r(t + Δt). We have illustrated the tangent vectors, and in the
small inset, we have illustrated the change in the tangent vectors, Δ ˆu T . For a small
increment Δt, we argue that the length of the Δ ˆu T vector is approximately given as
the length of the arc between the two tangent vectors, which is the angle Δφ between
the two vectors multiplied by the length of the vectors, which is 1. Now, we can relate
the angle Δφ to the local geometry of the curve by drawing a line AB normal to the
tangent vector in A, and a line A′ B normal to the tangent vector in A′. This forms a
triangle that is congruent with the small triangle formed by the tangent unit vectors,
the angle spanned by the two lines AB and AB′ is therefore Δφ. The length of AB
and AB′ is called the radius of curvature, ρ. The angle Δφ is also given as the arc
length from A to A′, which is the distance Δs along the trajectory, divided by the
local radius ρ:
Δφ = Δs
ρ . (8.10)
The direction of the change in the unit tangent vector is toward the center of the
circle, that is, toward the point B. We call this direction the normal direction, and
we call the unit vector pointing in this direction for the unit normal vector, ˆu N . The
change in the tangent vector is therefore:
Δ ˆu T = |Δ ˆu T | ˆu N = Δφ ˆu N = Δs
ρ ˆu N . (8.11)
The time derivative of the tangent vector is therefore:
d ˆu T (t)
dt = lim
Δt→0
Δu T
Δt = lim
Δt→0
Δs
ρΔt ˆu N = v(t) 1
ρ(t) ˆu N (t) . (8.12)
Now, we insert this expression back into the expression for the acceleration in (8.9),
getting
a(t) = dv
dt ˆu T (t) + v2(t)
ρ(t) ˆu N (t) . (8.13)
Here, we write that the radius of curvature, ρ(t), is a function of time, because the
radius of curvature is a function of the position along the curve, ρ(s), and the position
along the curve for the object is a function of time, s = s(t): ρ(t) = ρ(s(t)).
We have therefore shown that the acceleration vector can be written as
a(t) = a T (t) ˆu T (t) + a N (t) ˆu N (t) , (8.14)
220 8 Constrained Motion
where the tangential acceleration is
a T (t) = dv
dt , (8.15)
and the normal acceleration is
a N (t) = v2(t)
ρ . (8.16)
The magnitude of the normal acceleration, a N = v2/ρ is often called the sentripetal
acceleration of the object.
Uniform Circular Motion
These results can be simplified for uniform circular motion, where an object moves
in a circle with a constant speed, v. In this case, the speed v(t) does not change,
and the radius of curvature is constant and equal to the radius, R, of the circle. The
acceleration is therefore a N = v2/R, directed in towards the center of the circle.
This is illustrated by the motion diagram in Fig. 8.2.
Non-uniform Circular Motion
Figure 8.3 illustrates a motion diagram for a non-uniform circular motion: One case
where the speed is increasing and one case where the speed is decreasing. In both
cases, the radius of curvature is constant and equal to the radius, R, of the circle. The
acceleration is therefore
a = dv
dt ˆu T + v2
R ˆu N . (8.17)
Angular Coordinates
We can also specify a position on the circle by the angle φ(t) as illustrated in Fig. 8.3.
How are the distance s(t) and the angle φ(t) related? The distance s(t) corresponds
to the arc length along the circle:
s(t) = Rφ(t) . (8.18)
The two representations s(t) or φ(t) can both be used to represent the position, and
you may use whatever representation you find most practical.
The speed can be related to the rate of change of the angle, φ, since
ds
dt = d
dt (Rφ(t)) = R dφ
dt = Rω(t) , (8.19)

8.2.1 Example: Acceleration of a Matchbox Car
Problem: A matchbox car is spun around a horizontal, semi-circular track with a
radius of 20 cm. The car has an approximately constant speed v = 0.5 m/s throughout
the turn. (a) Find the acceleration of the car during the motion. (b) If you make the
circle half the diameter, will the acceleration of the car increase or decrease?
Solution: The car is moving with constant speed along a circular track. The motion
of the car is therefore constrained to follow a circular path. Since the car is moving
with constant speed, we argued above that the car only has a radial acceleration in
the direction toward the center of the circle, and with a magnitude:
a N = v2
R = (0.5 m/s)2
0.2 m = 1.25 m/s 2 . (8.20)
The acceleration is inversely proportional to the radius of the circle. If we reduce the
radius to one half, the acceleration will increase by a factor 2.

8.2.2 Example: Acceleration of a Rotating Rod
Problem: A rod of length L is rotating around an axis through one of its ends. The
rod is rotating at a constant speed so that it takes a time T for the rod to complete a
revolution. (a) Find the speed of a point P on the rod located a distance R from the
rotation axis. (b) Find the acceleration of the point P.
Solution: The rotating rod is illustrated in Fig. 8.4. The point P is located a distance
R from the rotation axis. Since the rod is rotating at a constant speed, the speed of the
point P on the rod is also constant, and the average speed is equal to the instantaneous
speed. We find the average speed over a complete revolution from the length the point
has traveled during a complete revolution and the time a revolution takes. The rod
completes a revolution in a time T , and the point P has moved a distance s = 2π R
along the whole, closed circular loop. We find the average speed of P as:
v = s
T = 2π R
T = 2π
T R , (8.21)
The quantity 2π/T is often called the angular frequency, or, as we will see later, the
angular velocity, and we usually use the symbol ω for this:
ω = 2π
T , (8.22)
we can therefore write:
v = Rω . (8.23)
8.2 Curved Motion 223
We find the acceleration of the point P by realizing that the point moves along a
circular path of radius R and with a speed v. The acceleration is therefore directed
in toward the center of the circle, which is also the rotation axis, and the magnitude
of the acceleration is given by the centripetal acceleration term:
a = v2
R = (Rω)2
R = Rω2 = R
( 2π

. (8.24)
8.2.3 Example: Normal Acceleration in Circular Motion
Problem: A ball is spun in a string in a circular path with radius R = 1 m. (a)
If the ball is spun at a constant speed of v = 2 m/s, find the tangential and normal
acceleration of the ball. (b) If the ball starts at rest and increases its speed at a constant
rate, dv/dt = 0.1 m/s 2 , find the tangential and normal accelerations of the ball as a
function of time.
Solution (a): The acceleration of the ball has a tangential and a normal component:
a T = dv
dt , a N = v2
ρ . (8.25)
Because the speed is constant, we have that dv/dt = 0, and the tangential acceleration
is zero. The radius of curvature, ρ for a circular path with radius R is the radius of
the circle, ρ = R. The tangential acceleration is therefore:
a N = v2
ρ = (2 m/s)2
1 m = 4 m/s2 . (8.26)
Solution (b): The speed of the ball is v(t). We know that the speed of the ball is
v(0) = 0 m/s when t = 0 s, and that dv/dt = 0.1 m/s 2 . We find the speed by
integration:
v(t) − v(0) =
∫ t
0
dv
dt dt =
∫ t
0
0.1 m/s dt = 0.1 m/s
∫ t
0
dt = 0.1 t m/s . (8.27)
We use this to find the tangential and normal acceleration:
a T = dv
dt = 0.1 m/s , a N = v2
ρ =
(0.1 t m/s2)2
1 m = 0.01 t2 m/s4 . (8.28)
We see that a T = a N when 0.1 s 2 = 0.01 t2 , that is for t = t∗ = √10 s. When
t < t∗ the tangential acceleration is larger than the normal acceleration, and when
t > t∗ the normal acceleration is larger than the tangential acceleration.

Summary
Constrained motion:
• Constrained motion is motion along a given path, for example, a bead on a wire
is constrained to follow the wire.
• We describe motion along a curve by the distance, s(t), along the path, as a function
of time, t.
• Mathematically, any motion r(t) can be decomposed into a path, r(s), and motion
along the path, s(t).
Linear motion:
• In Linear motion, the motion of an object is restricted to a straight line.
• We orient the x-axis along the line, and describe the position of the object with
x(t) = s(t).
• The velocity and acceleration of the object are also directed along the line: v(t) =
(ds/dt) = (dx/dt), a(t) = (dx/dt).

Circular motion:
• In circular motion the object is constrained to move along a circle of radius R.
• The velocity of the object is tangential to the circle (and normal to the radius):
v(t) = v ˆu T (t)
• For motion with constant speed, the acceleration is directed in toward the center
of the circle.
• For motion with varying speed, the acceleration has both tangential and normal
components: a(t) = (dv/dt) ˆu T (t) + (v2(t)/R) ˆu N (t)

General motion:
• We describe a constraining curve by the r(s), parameterized by the path length,
s, along the curve. The position of an object is r(s(t)), where s(t) is the position
along the curve.
• The velocity of the object is tangential to the curve: v(t) = v(t) ˆu T (t)
• The acceleration of the object has both tangential and normal components: a(t) =
(dv/dt) ˆu T (t) + (v2(t)/ρ(t)) ˆu N (t) where ρ(s(t)) is the radius of curvature of
the curve at r(s(t)).

Chapter 9
Forces and Constrained Motion
You have now learned to determine the motion of an object based on an analysis of
the forces acting on the object and the application of Newton’s second law. We use
the structured problem-solving approach to first identify the moving object, model
the forces acting to produce an equation of motion, solve the equations of motion to
find the motion, and analyze the results to answer questions about the motion. This
method is very robust—it works as long as we have good models for all the forces.
For example, if you drop a steel box onto a wooden table, you have learned to
use a spring model to approximate the normal force from the table on the box while
the two are in contact, as illustrated in Fig. 9.1. The normal force, N , depends on the
position, x, of the bottom of the box:
N =
{ −kx x < 0
0 x ≥ 0 (9.1)
However, if the box is lying at rest on the table, we do not need a force model to find
the normal force on the box. We can instead use our knowledge about the motion
of the box—we know that it is not moving—and apply Newton’s second law to
determine the normal force, N , to be equal to the gravitational force, G, on the box:
∑ F = N − G = ma = 0 ⇒ N = G . (9.2)
In this case the motion of the box is constrained: We know that it is not moving in
the direction of gravity. For constrained motion we can therefore calculate some of
the forces without a force model!
First, why is this interesting? If we already know that the box is not moving in
the direction of gravity, why would we need to know the forces acting on the box
in this direction? Was not the whole point of introducing quantitative models for the
forces that we could use this to determine the motion? It turns out that some force
models, such as the model for friction, depends on the normal force on the object. In
this case, we need to know the normal force to find the force acting in the direction

Fig. 9.1 Illustration of a box in contact with a surface. Left figure shows the gravitational, G, and
normal force, N , on the box when the box is released from a small height above the floor. Right
figure shows the gravitational and normal force when the box is lying (almost) still on the floor. The
forces and vertical motion of the box has been exaggerated
of the motion. Also, there are many cases where the motion is constrained only for
a certain range of normal forces: For example, the attachment of a roller coaster cart
may only sustain a certain maximum force before breaking, or the motion of a ball in
a rope is only constrained by the rope as long as the rope is tight. In both these cases
it is an advantage if we can find forces such as the normal force without introducing
a force model.
Second, you may object that it is not really true that the box is not moving in the
direction of gravity. The box is never completely at rest on the table, it still oscillates
slightly up and down, and the normal force varies slightly. That is correct, but we
always make many similar approximations. Generally, if the oscillations are very
small, we ignore them, and the corresponding variation in forces, and assume that
the motion is constrained.
In this chapter we will discuss the use of constrained motion to simplify problems.
First, we demonstrate how we try to choose coordinate systems wisely so that motion
only occurs along some of the axes. This technique is often called “decomposition of
forces”, and it simplifies the analysis of a problem, because only force components
in the directions that the object can move can contribute to the acceleration of the
object along its path.
We will also introduce a new force model, the friction force model, which allows
us to model forces during the relative motion of two solids. This model has a long
history and allows us to study many classical examples, even though the physical
origin of friction forces is poorly understood.
We will also study more complicated constrained motions, such as the circular
motion of an object attached to a rope, or the motion of a car driving along a curved
road or a hilltop. In these cases the constraints are only valid for a limited range of
the normal forces, and care must be taken to find when the limits are exceeded.

9.1 Linear Constraints
No Motion—Statics
Let us start with the simplest example of a constrained motion—an object that is not
moving at all. In this case, we are not interested in determining the motion of the
object, but instead we want to find the forces acting on the object from the constraint
that the object is not moving, and that the net force on the object therefore is zero.
Such problems are typically called equilibrium problems, or static problems.
For example, let us analyze a car standing on the ground, as illustrated in Fig. 9.2a.
We follow the first steps in the structured problem-solving approach. First, we identify
the object, which in this case is the car.
Second, we model the interactions between the object and the environment by
identifying the forces acting on the object and by introducing quantitative models
for the forces. The free-body diagram for the car is illustrated in Fig. 9.2b. The only
contact forces are acting on the wheels of the car from the ground, and we call these
contact forces N1 and N2 . 1 In addition, there is a gravitational force, G. Both the
normal forces and the gravitational force act in the y-direction only.
We have a quantitative model for the gravitational force, G = −mg j, where m
is the mass of the car. However, we do not know the normal forces. Instead, we will
use Newton’s second law to determine the forces given the constraint we have on the
motion—the car is not moving.
Because the car is not moving, the acceleration of the car is zero, a = 0. Newton’s
second law therefore gives:
∑ F = N1 + N2 + G = m a = 0 . (9.3)
N1 + N2 = −G = mg j . (9.4)
1 On a real car there are of course four contact forces acting on the four wheels of the car.
232 9 Forces and Constrained Motion

(b)
Fig. 9.3 a Illustration of a car pushed along a horizontal surface. b Free-body diagram for the car
We have found that the sum of the normal forces equals the opposite of the
gravitational force.
Generally, we do not know how the total normal force is divided between the nor-
mal forces. 2 For example, if the car has a very large load in the luggage room in the
back, we expect the back suspensions to be more compressed than the front suspen-
sions, which suggest that the normal force on the back of the car is larger than on the
front of the car. On the other hand, if the engine in the front of the car is very heavy,
we would expect the front wheels to experience a larger load than the back wheels.
It is therefore common to only draw a single contact point for the car, where the
sum, N, of the normal forces are acting:
N = N1 + N2 . (9.5)
Equilibrium Along One Axis, Motion Along the Other
Let us now look at a slightly more complicated problem, a car moving in a straight
line along a flat surface, as illustrated in Fig. 9.3. In this case the motion of the car
is constrained to a line, and the forces acting on the car are either directed along the
line or are normal to the line. Notice that since the car is constrained to move along
a line, the acceleration normal to the line is zero.
Let us analyze the motion of the car when a horizontal force F is applied, as show
in Fig. 9.3. The forces acting on the car are illustrated in Fig. 9.3. The contact forces
are the two normal force, N1 and N2 , as we introduced above, the externally applied
force, F, acting horizontally, and the gravitational force G. We assume that the effects
of friction and air resistance are negligible.
We have a force model for the gravitational force, G = −mg j, and we assume
that we know the value of the externally applied force, F.
2 As we will see later, we can determine each of the normal forces by making a similar assumption
about the rotation of the car: the car is not rotating.
9.1 Linear Constraints 233
We can determine both the motion of the object and the normal forces by applying
Newton’s second law. We recall that Newton’s law is a vector equation, and that it
can be applied along each unit vector independently:
∑ F = N1 + N2 + G + F = ma . (9.6)
N1j + N2j − Gj + Fi = ma = ma x i + ma y j . (9.7)
This can be written as two sets of equations, one for motion along the x-axis, and
one for motion along the y-axis:
F = ma x
N1 + N2 + G = ma y (9.8)
Since the car is moving along the x-axis, the acceleration along the y-axis is zero:
N1 + N2 + G = ma y = 0 , (9.9)
and
N1 + N2 = −G = mg . (9.10)
The forces in the y-direction are therefore the same as we found above.
The motion in the x-direction is given by the forces acting in the x-direction, as
we have found previously.
This analysis demonstrates how we decompose the motion into
• motion along the constraint, and
• motion normal to the constraint.
This is done through the analysis of force, where we similarly decompose the
forces into
• forces along the constraint, and
• forces normal to the constraint.
In this particular case all forces are acting either along or normal to the line of
constraint. Consequently, the analysis is particularly simple.
Decomposition of Forces
We are now ready to add one more complication, and address motion where the
external forces are not simply parallel to or normal to the motion, but where there are
234 9 Forces and Constrained Motion

Fig. 9.4 a Illustration of a car rolling down an inclined slope. b Free-body diagram for the car
force components both parallel to and normal to the motion. In this case, the use of
decomposition of forces becomes more important, and we will demonstrate how we
use this technique combined with the application of Newton’s second law through
an example.
Let us study the motion of a car rolling down an inclined slope, as illustrated in
Fig. 9.4. We realize that also in this case the car is constrained to move along the
surface of the slope. We determine the motion of the car by identifying and modeling
the forces acting on the car. The contact forces on the car are the normal force, N1
and N2 . These act normal to the surface. We have chosen the coordinate system
to be oriented along the inclined slope so that the x-axis points in the direction of
motion—what we called along the constraint—and the y-axis points in a direction
normal to the constraint. We assume that we can neglect the effects of friction and
air resistance.
In addition, the car is subject to a gravitational force, G. The gravitational force
is directed along the vertical axis, which we have called the y′-axis in Fig. 9.4.
We decompose the forces in the x- and y-directions, parallel and normal to the
direction of motion for the car. We notice that the normal forces are directed along
the y-axis:
N1 = N1 j , N2 = N2 j . (9.11)
The gravitational force, G, is not parallel to the x- or the y-axis, but we can decompose
it into two components along these directions. From Fig. 9.4 we see that the x- and
y-components of gravity can be written as:
G x = G sin α , G y = −G cos α . (9.12)
The gravitational force is therefore:
G = G x i + G y j . (9.13)
where the gravitational force model gives the value, G = mg, for the gravitational
force on the car.
9.1 Linear Constraints 235
Notice that we have decomposed the forces in the direction of motion, which is
given by the constraint, and in the direction normal to motion. This allows us to apply
Newton’s laws of motion in each direction, separating the motion along the surface
from motion normal to the surface.
We apply Newton’s second law of motion to the car:
∑ F = N1 + N2 + G = m a . (9.14)
We write the vectors on component form:
N1 j + N2 j + G x i + G y j = ma x i + ma y j . (9.15)
We can separate this into two equations, one equation for the x-axis and one equation
for the y-axis:
G x = ma x (9.16)
N1 + N2 + G y = ma y (9.17)
Because we know that the car is only moving along the surface, the acceleration in
the y-direction is zero, giving:
N1 + N2 = −G y = G cos α = mg cos α . (9.18)
We have therefore found that sum of normal forces on the car balances the component
of the gravitational force that is normal to the surface.
We find that motion along the x-axis is determined by:
a x = G x
m = mg sin α
m = g sin α . (9.19)
We can therefore use our tools to solve motion with constant acceleration to find the
motion along the x-axis.
Notice the use of decomposition: We choose a coordinate system so that one or
more axes are directed in a direction where we know that there is no motion.
Above we chose the y-axis to be directed normal to the surface and the x-
axis to be along the direction of motion. We apply Newton’s second law in
the directions where there are no motion to determine the other forces in this
direction. Then, we find force components in the direction of motion, which
determine the acceleration and hence the motion of the object along the surface.
This approach is general, and can be applied to a wide range of problems where
motion is constrained to a line.

Fig. 9.5 a Illustration of
bead on a vertical wire. b
Free-body diagram of the
bead
(a) (b)
9.1.1 Example: A Bead in the Wind
Problem: A bead is sliding without friction along a vertical wire. A wind with a
constant wind speed of w is blowing horizontally. Find the force from the wire on
the bead and the acceleration of the bead. You can use a linear air resistance law for
the bead.
Approach: We find the net force along the bead, including the effect of air resistance,
and use this to find the acceleration along the wire and the forces normal to the wire
from Newton’s second law.
Identify: The center of the bead, given by r(t), must move along the wire. We
therefore choose the y-axis to be along the wire in the vertical direction, and the
x-axis to be directed in the direction the wind is blowing. (See Fig. 9.5a).
Model: The contact forces on the bead are the force from the wire on the bead, N;
the air drag force, FD ; and gravity G = −mg j. The air drag force depends on the
velocity v of the bead relative to the velocity w of the wind:
FD = −k v (v − w) , (9.20)
These forces are illustrated in the free-body diagram for the bead in Fig. 9.5b.
We decompose in the x- and y-direction. Gravity acts vertically, and therefore
along the y-axis. The air drag depends on the velocity, v, of the bead. Since the bead
moves only in the vertical direction, along the wire, the velocity only has a vertical
component:
v = v y j . (9.21)
The velocity of the air is in the positive x-direction:
w = w i . (9.22)
9.1 Linear Constraints 237
The air drag force is therefore:
FD = F D,x i + F D,y j , (9.23)
where we find Fx from:
F D,x = FD · i = −k v (v − w) · i = −k v (v · i − w · i) = −k v (0 − w) = k v w
(9.24)
And, similarly, we find the y-component:
F D,y = FD · j = −k v v y , (9.25)
We also notice that the normal force, N, only has a component along the x-axis. We
have now decomposed the forces, and can apply Newton’s second law along the x-
and y-directions.
Since the bead is constrained not to move in the x-direction, we know that the
acceleration in the x-direction is zero. Newton’s law along the x-axis therefore gives:
∑ Fx = F D,x − N = ma x = 0 ⇒ N = F D,x = k v w . (9.26)
The normal force is therefore constant for this particular model of the motion!
We find the acceleration of the bead by applying Newton’s law in the y-direction:
∑ F y = F D,y − G = −k v v y − mg = ma y ⇒ a y = − k v
m v y − g . (9.27)
From these equations you know how to find the motion of the bead. For this particular
formulation of the problem, it is decoupled—the motion of the bead in the y-direction
does not depend on the wind velocity.
Test your understanding: How would this problem change if you used a square-law for the air
drag?
9.2 Force Model—Friction
We have now addressed constrained motion such as the motion of a block sliding
along a surface as illustrated in Fig. 9.6. We have shown that we can use Newton’s
second law in combination with the constraint to determine the normal force on the
block without including a force model for the contact. For the case illustrated in
Fig. 9.6, we can apply Newton’s second law in the vertical direction to find:
∑ F y = N − G = N − mg = ma y = 0 , (9.28)
N = mg , (9.29)
238 9 Forces and Constrained Motion
Fig. 9.6 Left Illustration of a crate on the floor. Right A free-body diagram of a crate on the floor.
You are trying to push the crate with the force F directed along the floor
But so far there has been no coupling between the forces normal to the surface and
the forces along the surface—the tangential forces. The magnitude of the normal
force has no impact on the motion of the block.
In real systems there are several mechanisms that introduce a coupling between the
normal and tangential forces. When we discuss macroscopic systems it is common
to group these mechanisms into a common term: friction. Friction is a force acting
on the contact between two objects, it acts tangential to the contact, and it depends
on the magnitude of the normal force at this contact. The introduction of a force
model for friction forces is therefore essential in order to get a realistic description
of contact forces. Unfortunately, the concept of friction is not that well defined. The
mechanisms of friction are currently not well understood, and are subjects of current
research. There is also not only one, single mechanism responsible for the tangential
forces acting on a contact—there are many different mechanisms acting all at the
same time, including effects such as surface geometry and roughness, the effect of
thin fluid films, surfactants, and dirt on the surfaces, the effect of adhesion forces
and plastic deformation of small asperities on the contact surface, the effect of the
external boundaries, and many more. In addition, it is also clear that the scale you are
studying is important: For example on very small scales inter-atomic forces and the
presence of individual atoms or molecules along the surface can affect the tangential
forces acting.
But wait, you interrupt, I already know something about friction, and it is a simple
law! Yes. Already in 1699 Amontons reported the experimental observations that we
today also call the “laws of friction”:
Amonton’s laws of dynamic friction:
• The friction force is proportional to the normal force: F = μN .
• The friction force does not depend on the apparent contact area.
This is an experimental observation that turns out to be surprisingly robust, in par-
ticular considering that it includes so many different effects! In this section we will
motivate and discuss the force model for friction as a contact force acting in the tan-
gential direction along any contact between two solids. We will introduce a model for
9.2 Force Model—Friction 239
the static friction force for the case when the two surfaces are not moving relative to
each other, and a model for the dynamic friction force when the surfaces are moving
relative to each other.
Static Friction
We all have a good intuition for solid friction because it is an important force in our
macroscopic world. If you want to push a heavy crate along the floor, you know that
you need to apply a certain force to “get it going”. If you do not push hard enough,
it will not start moving. You may also know that if you want to keep it moving, you
must constantly apply a force to it, otherwise it will stop moving. If you give the crate
a hard push, it will start moving, but you know that it will decelerate and stop after
some distance. These simple insights provides us with some of the basic properties
of a the friction force
Sliding box model system: Let us analyze the motion of a crate on a flat floor in detail
(See Fig. 9.6 for an illustration). You push on the crate with a horizontal force, F.
The motion of the crate is determined by the forces acting on it: The applied force, F,
the normal force N from the floor, and the gravitational force, G. The crate is cannot
move down through the floor—it is constrained not to move in the y-direction. We
can therefore use Newton’s second law in the y-direction to determine the normal
force:
∑ F y = N − G = N − mg = ma y = 0 ⇒ N = mg . (9.30)
We also know, from our experience or from staging a simple experiment, that when
the applied force, F, is small, the crate is not moving in the horizontal direction.
However, according to Newton’s second law of motion the horizontal acceleration
is given by the net horizontal force:
∑ Fx = ma x . (9.31)
Because the crate is not moving, the sum of the forces must be zero. Consequently,
the crate cannot only be affected by the applied force F in the horizontal direction.
There must be an additional force, counteracting the applied force. This force must
come from the contact with the floor. And the force has the apparently “magical”
property that it is exactly equal to the applied, horizontal force! If you push with a
very small force, F0 , then the force from the floor will be exactly the same but in the
opposite direction. If you push with a slightly larger force, F1 , then the force from
the floor will again be exactly the same, but in the opposite direction. In this respect
the friction force is similar to the normal force from the floor on the crate, which in
the static situation matches the force from gravity. We call the force from the floor
on the crate the static friction force
240 9 Forces and Constrained Motion
Microscopic model for static friction: The word static indicates that it is the friction
along a surface when the object does not move relative to the surface. We can develop
a simple model for the origin of the static friction force from a microscopic picture
of the contact. On the microscopic scale, the contact between the crate and the floor
consists of many, small irregularities: small bumps on the surface of the floor and the
surface of the crate. When the crate is placed on the surface, these irregularities are
pressed together. One possible explanation is that in this process, the irregularities
are “glued” together due to adhesive forces between the two materials. This glue acts
like small springs, so that when we try to push at the crate, these small springs are
extended, exerting forces that counteract the applied force. However, if the applied
force on the crate becomes too large, the adhesive forces become so large that the
contacts break, and the crate starts to slip.
It is reasonable to assume that the number of irregularities that are in contact,
and possibly the contact area of each irregularity, increase with the normal force.
This means that we should discern between the apparent area of contact, which is
simply the size of the side of crate facing the floor, and the actual area of contact,
which is given by the contact areas of all the small irregularities. If the actual contact
area is proportional to the normal force, we expect the static friction force also to be
proportional to the normal force.
The simple model we have developed now, based only on our intuition, is surpris-
ingly close to the most usual description of static friction. By the word “law” here,
we mean a model for the force — it is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a
model that can often, but not always, be applied to contact problems.
Coefficient of static friction: The upper limit of the static friction force is Fm =
μs N , where N is the normal force for the contact, and μs is called the coefficient
of static friction. If the friction force exceeds this upper limit, the object will start
moving relative to the surface, and our model for static friction is no longer valid.
We see that the concept of static friction is closely related to a constraint on the
motion of an object:
The static friction force is a tangential force acting on the interface between
two solids in contact that are not moving relative to each other. The magnitude
and direction of the force is so that the two object do not accelerate relative
to each other. However, there is an upper limit on the magnitude of the static
friction force
Fs < Fs,max = μs N , (9.32)
where N is the normal force at the contact.
In order to determine the static friction force we need to assume that the objects
are not accelerating, that is, we need to assume a constraint on the motion, and use
Newton’s second law of motion to determine the static friction force. Then, we need
9.2 Force Model—Friction 241
Fig. 9.7 Left Illustration of a crate moving along the floor. Right A free-body diagram of a crate
on the floor. You are pushing the crate with the force F directed along the floor
to check that the force does not exceed the threshold. If it exceeds the threshold, the
objects will start moving relative to each other, and we need another force model—the
dynamic friction model.
This law is experimentally justified and it is only an approximation of the real
behavior of materials, where many different effects contribute to bring about the
effect of a static friction force.
Dynamic Friction
You are gradually increasing how hard you are pushing a crate on the floor. What
happens when the crate slips? Our model so far has been for static friction. However,
you know from your own experience that if you give the crate an initial velocity
and release it along the floor, it slows downs and stops (see Fig. 9.7). That means
that the crate decelerates. We can therefore use Newton’s second law and conclude
that because the crate decelerates, there must be a force acting along the floor in the
direction opposite the movement, which is the cause of the deceleration. We call this
force the dynamic friction force.
There is a surprisingly simple law for the dynamic friction force, Fd , acting on
an object in contact with another object:
The dynamic friction force, Fd , is tangential to the surface of contact. The
magnitude of the force is Fd = μd N where N is the normal force across the
contact. The direction of the force is opposite the relative motion of the two
objects.
This law is empirically based. This means that it is the result of measurements. The
law states that the dynamic friction force depends only on the normal force and
on the coefficient of friction, which is a property of the two materials in contact.
The dynamic friction force does not depend on the area of contact. Neither does
it depend on the velocity of the object relative to the floor. This is surprising—we

would expect the force to be higher for higher velocities. For high velocities, there
will be a velocity dependence, but for most problems related to objects you typically
find around you—macroscopic objects—the law holds reasonably well.
9.2.1 Example: Static Friction Forces
Problem: A book is lying on a table tilted an angle α = 30◦ with the horizontal.
The coefficient of static friction between the book and the table is μs = 2/3. What
is the friction force on the book? At what tilting angle will the book start to slide?
Approach: Does the book move? We start from the assumption that the book is not
moving—a special case of constrained motion—and check if the conditions for static
friction are fulfilled. If they are not fulfilled, the book starts to slide.
Identify: As shown in Fig. 9.8 we choose the x-axis to be directed along the table
so that forces tangential to the surface are along the x-axis and forces normal to the
surface are along the y-axis.
Model: The contact forces from the table on the book are the normal force N and the
friction force F. In addition, the book is affected by gravity, G = mg, as illustrated
in the free-body diagram in Fig. 9.8.
We apply Newton’s second law in the x- and y-direction, decomposing W along
each direction as illustrated in Fig. 9.8. We have assumed no motion in the x-direction:
∑ Fx = f − G x = ma x = 0 ⇒ f = G x = G sin α = mg sin α . (9.33)
And, similarly no motion in the y-direction:
∑ F y = N − G y = ma y = 0 ⇒ N = G y = mg cos α . (9.34)
As long as the book is not moving, F is a result of static friction. But there is a limit
on the static friction force: f < fmax = μs N . If the static friction force exceeds this
limit, the book starts to slide.
9.2 Force Model—Friction 243
First, let us check if the static friction force is exceeded when α = 30◦ and
μs = 2/3. In this case cos α = √3/2,
N = mg cos α =
√3
2 mg , (9.35)
and the maximum static friction force is:
fmax = μs N = 2
3
√3
2 mg =
√3
3 mg . (9.36)
We found above that when the book is not moving the friction force is:
f = mg sin α = 1
2 mg , (9.37)
which is smaller than the maximum friction force. The book does not slide.
Let us find at what angle the book starts to slide. Sliding occurs when the friction
force becomes equal to the maximum friction force. For smaller angles than this,
the book does not slide, but for an angle large than this, the book starts sliding. This
angle is called the angle of marginal stability, αm . It is found from
f = fm (9.38)
sin(αm ) mg = μs cos(αm ) mg (9.39)
sin(αm )
cos(αm ) = μs (9.40)
αm = arctan(μs ) . (9.41)
We should check if this result is reasonable by testing the behavior for large and
small values of μs . When μs is small, αm is also small, which is the correct behavior,
When μs becomes very large, αm approaches π/2, which is also the correct result.
9.2.2 Example: Dynamic Friction of a Block Sliding up a Hill
Problem: In order to build a pyramid, in case you are planning for greatness, you
need to push large blocks of rock up an inclined hill. (Unless, of course, you have
access to a lift). It has been suggested that the Egyptians made ramps of sand in
order to push and pull the rocks up to their place. Let us assume they were able to
make a ramp with an inclination of α = 5◦. What force is needed to push a rock
of mass 6000 kg up this hill? A typical coefficient of dynamic friction between rock
(sandstone) and sand is μd = 0.6.
244 9 Forces and Constrained Motion
Fig. 9.9 Left Illustration of a rock block being pushed up along a hill. Right Free-body diagram
for the block
Sketch and Identify: The problem is illustrated in Fig. 9.9. We have chosen the
coordinate system so that x is along the inclined hill.
Model: The rock is in contact with a pushing and/or pulling mechanism: The rock
may be pulled by ropes and pushed at the bottom. We call the sum of both of these
forces, F, which acts along the slope, in the x-direction. The rock is also in contact
with the sand slope. There is a normal force, N , from the slope on the rock, and there
is friction force acting along the slope from the slope on the rock. Because the rock
is moving relative to the slope, we use the dynamic friction model for the friction
force, f = μd N , acting in the negative x-direction.
We apply Newton’s second law in each direction. The block does not move in the
y-direction:
∑ F y = N − G y = ma y = 0 , (9.42)
where we find G y from the inset in Fig. 9.9, G y = G cos(α), which gives
N = G y = G cos(θ) = mg cos(θ) . (9.43)
Newton’s law of motion in the x-direction gives:
∑ Fx = F − f − G x = ma x . (9.44)
Now, the smallest force exerted in order to move the block up the hill, is the force
required to keep the block at constant velocity, that is, the force that makes the
acceleration a x = 0:
F = f + G x . (9.45)
From the inset in Fig. 9.9 we find that G x = G sin(α) = mg sin(α) . We solve by
inserting f = μd N into (9.44).
9.2 Force Model—Friction 245
F = f + G x
= μd N + G x = μd mg cos(θ) + mg sin(θ)
= mg (μd cos(θ) + sin(θ))
= 6000 kg · 9.81 m/s 2 (0.6 · cos(5◦) + sin(5◦))
 40.3 kN . (9.46)
Test your understanding: The Egyptians knew that sliding a big block of rock on sand required
too large forces, because the friction was too large. Therefore, they invented an improved method:
They laid down wooden plates in front of the block, and poured water onto the plates. This reduced
the effective dynamic coefficient of friction to μd = 0.2. What is the force needed in this case?
9.2.3 Example: Oscillations During an Earthquake
The numerical implementation of the models for friction forces may seem straight-
forward, but sometimes poses unexpected problems. In this exercise you will learn
to implement both dynamic and static friction in a numerical model of motion under
friction.
Problem: A real, rough surface typically consists of many individual asperities—
small protrusions that make up the real contacts along the surface. Here, we will
address the motion of one such asperity along a contact surface during an earthquake.
The system is sketched in Fig. 9.10. How can we make a simplified model of this
system? The asperity will deform and slide as the two surfaces are moving relatively to
each other during the earthquake. We propose a very simple model for this interaction:
We model the asperity as a block of mass m, attached to the top surface with a spring
of stiffness k. The block is pressed down onto the underlying surface with a force
F N . The attachment point x0 of the spring follows the motion of the top surface.
We will assume that the top surface, and therefore x0 , oscillates as x0(t) = A sin ωt
during the earthquake. Find the motion of the asperity.
Identify and Sketch: We describe the position of the block by x(t), its position
relative to the bottom surface. We assume that the block starts at rest from x(t) = 0
at t = 0.

246 9 Forces and Constrained Motion
Model: The block is affected by contact forces from the top surface: a force F N
and the spring force, F D , due to the spring attached at point x0(t). The block is
also affected by contact forces from the bottom surface: A normal contact force N
and a friction force f acting along the surface. The free-body diagram is shown in
Fig. 9.10.
We apply Newton’s second law in the direction normal to the surface
∑ F y = N − F N = 0 ⇒ N = F N . (9.47)
Newton’s law of motion along the surface gives:
∑ Fx = F D − f = −k (x − x0(t)) − f = ma . (9.48)
However, we now also need a model for the friction force f , but that depends on
whether the block is moving. If it is moving, the force model is
f = −sign(v) μd F N , (9.49)
where μd is the coefficient of dynamic friction. However, if the block is not moving,
the force f will correspond to the force F D , unless it then exceeds the maximum
static friction force μs F N .
Initiation of sliding: The block starts from rest and will start moving if the force f
exceeds the maximum static friction force, that is, if:
f = F D = −k (x − x0(t)) > μs F N , (9.50)
where x = 0 and x0(t) = A sin ωt. The maximum value of f occurs when x0 = A,
which gives
k A > μs F N . (9.51)
The block will therefore only start moving if A > μs F N /k.
Block dynamics: We find the motion of the block by integrating Newton’s second
law for the horizontal motion:
ma = F D − f = −k (x − x0(t)) − f . (9.52)
We solve this equation numerically, using an Euler-Cromer scheme for integration:
v(t + Δt) = v(t) + a(t) Δt (9.53)
x(t + Δt) = x(t) + v(t + Δt) Δt , (9.54)
9.2 Force Model—Friction 247
However, to implement the effect of the friction force f , we need to consider the state
of the block. The block may be sliding; still; or transitioning from sliding to still or
from still to sliding. If the block is sliding, we use the dynamic friction model. If the
block is still, we use the static friction model. The force calculation is implemented
as follows:
x0 = A*sin(omega*t[i])
FD = -k*(x[i]-x0)
if v[i]==0.0: # Static friction
f = -FD
if abs(f)>mus*N: # Slips
f = -sign(FD)*mud*N
else: # Dynamic friction
f = -sign(v[i])*mud*N
Fnet = FD + f
#
First, we calculate the other forces, F D , acting on the block. Then we check if the
block is sticking, which occurs when the velocity is zero. In this case, the force will
be the static friction force, Fs , which is equal to the other forces, Fs = −F D , so
that the net force is zero. However, this is only true if the static friction force is less
than the friction threshold. If the force exceeds the friction threshold, the block will
start moving in a direction given by the force F D , and the block will experience a
dynamic force acting in a direction opposite F D and with a magnitude given by the
dynamic friction force, f = −sign(F D )μd N .
Changing the frictional state: Notice that this method checks if the velocity is
exactly equal to zero, but this will never occur during a simulation. During an inte-
gration step the velocity will move from being positive to being negative without
ever being precisely zero. However, when the velocity of the block changes sign,
the block will actually stop and start sticking to the surface with a static friction
force. We therefore set the velocity to be exactly zero when the velocity changes
sign. (Alternatively, you could have introduced a state variable, telling if the block
is in a sliding or a sticking state). This check needs to be done during integration:
v[i+1] = v[i] + a*dt
if (v[i]!=0.0) and (sign(v[i+1])!=sign(v[i])):
v[i+1] = 0.0 # The block has stopped
We now have all the components needed for a program to solve the motion of the
block:
# Initialize
m = 2e-12; # kg

9.3 Circular Motion 249
9.3 Circular Motion
How large forces acts on a roller coaster cart as it passes through a vertical loop, or
on a car as it drives through a shape turn on the road? These are questions we can
answer without having a specific model for the forces acting, because the motion is
constrained: A roller coaster cart driving around a loop is constrained to follow the
loop, since the cart is attached to the rail.
We have already seen how we can use constraints to find forces for linear motion.
Fortunately, we can use exactly the same technique to determine the forces acting
on an object following a curve. However, for curved motion we know that the accel-
eration also has a component normal to the curve: The centripetal acceleration. For
curved motion we must therefore remember that even though the object follows a
particular path, there must be a net force acting on the object in order for it to follow
the path.
Linear and Curved Motion
We can illustrate the difference between linear and curved motion by looking at a
bead moving along a wire, as illustrated in Fig. 9.12.
If the wire is shaped as a line, the bead can be accelerated along the wire but not
normal to the wire. Hence, if we analyze the forces acting on the bead and apply
Newton’s second law, we recognize that the net force in the x-direction along the
wire corresponds to the acceleration along the wire:
∑ Fx = ma x . (9.55)
Fig. 9.12 Left Illustration of a bead moving along a straight (linear) wire left and a circular (curved)
wire (right)
250 9 Forces and Constrained Motion
But in the direction normal to the wire (the y-direction), there is no motion and no
acceleration. Therefore the net force is zero:
∑ F y = ma y = 0 . (9.56)
If the wire is shaped as a circle, the analysis is different. Let us describe the motion
of the bead using a coordinate system with one axis along the curve, the tangential
axis, ˆu T ; and one axis normal to the curve pointing in towards the center of the
circle, the normal axis, ˆu N . Again, we analyze the forces acting on the bead and
apply Newton’s second law. The net force in the tangential direction is causing the
tangential acceleration:
∑ FT = ma T , (9.57)
But in this case, the motion is not linear. Therefore, even though the bead follows
the wire, it is accelerated also in the direction normal to the wire because the wire
is curved. The net force in the normal direction is therefore related to the centripetal
acceleration:
∑ F N = ma N = m v2
R . (9.58)
This important difference between linear and curved motion is at the center of our
analysis of curved constrained motion.
Structured Problem-Solving Approach
The method we apply when analyzing motion along a curved track consists of the
following modification to the Model step in the structured problem-solving method:
• Find the forces acting on the object.
• Introduce models for the forces.
• In the normal direction the net force must produce the centripetal acceleration:
a N = v2/R
• In the tangential direction the tangential acceleration is determined from the net
tangential force.
You may then Solve to find the motion of the object and Analyze the solution to
answer questions about the motion.
Types of Constraints
We can classify the constraints into two main types.
Non-conditional constraint: The constraint experienced by a bead moving along
a wire. The bead follows the wire independently of the speed of the motion or any
other property of the motion. Other similar cases are the motion of a weight attached
to a rigid staff; the motion of a roller coaster car attached to a track; the motion of a
9.3 Circular Motion 251
person attached to a seat; or the motion of a train along a railway track. In the cases
of a non-conditional constraint we can determine the forces and motion using the
approach presented above.
Conditional constraint: The constraint experienced by a ball swung in a rope: As
long as the rope is tight, the ball follows a circular path, because the rope pulls on the
ball when stretched. But the rope does not exert any force when pushed. This means
that the constraint in conditional: The ball is constrained to follow a circle only as
long as the tensile force needed to make it follow a circle is positive. If the tensile
force needed is negative, the rope cannot push the ball, and the constraint is no longer
present. In this case the ball is only affected by gravity and air resistance until the
rope is again tight. If you want to determine the motion of the ball when the rope is
not tight, you apply Newton’s laws of motion to find the acceleration and solve to
find the position and velocity of the ball using methods you are now proficient in.
Examples of Constrained Systems
A car on a hill-top: Usually we assume that a car driving along a bumpy road follows
the vertical motion of the road. This is really a constraint on the motion: We assume
that the car follows the path given by the road. If the car drives along a flat part of
the road, this gives us a way to estimate the normal force. However, the normal force
can only be positive: The car is not glued to the surface. The constraint on the motion
of the car is therefore conditional: It can only follow the shape of the surface if this
requires a positive normal force. If a negative normal force is required in order to
follow the surface, the car looses contact with the surface.
A car driving through a curve: Usually, we assume that a car driving around a
turn does not slide. The car therefore follows a specific track—the track given by
the road. We can therefore analyze the motion of the car around a turn as if it was
constrained—following a given curved track. This requires a net force on the car
to give it the necessary centripetal acceleration. An important component in the net
force is the friction force from the ground on the tires. But the friction force is limited
by the maximum static friction force. Hence, the motion of the car is constrained to
follow the curve, but only as long as the friction force is not exceeding its maximum.
9.3.1 Example: A Car Driving Through a Curve
Problem: A car is driving through a circular curve at constant speed. The coefficient
of static friction between the tires of the car and the ground is μs . The speed of the
car is v and the radius of the circle is R. How fast can the car drive before slipping?
Approach: This is an example of a conditional constrained problem: The car is
constrained to follow a circular path, but only as long as the static friction force
needed to give the car the required centripetal acceleration does not exceed the
maximum frictional force.

Identify: In this problem we address the motion of a car driving through a circular
curve. We address the motion of the car as it passes the x-axis, as illustrated in
Fig. 9.13. The motion of the car is in the x y-plane.
Model: The car is in contact with the road, giving rise to several contact forces: a
normal force in the vertical direction, N , and a frictional force, f , from the ground
on the car. The friction force has a component f y along the road and a component f x
normal to the road (in the x-direction). In addition, the car is affected by the gravity,
G = mg in the z-direction. The free-body diagram of the car is shown in Fig. 9.13b.
We relate the forces acting on the car to its acceleration by applying Newton’s
second law. The car is not moving in the vertical (z) direction, hence the acceleration
a z is zero:
∑ Fz = N − G = N − mg = ma z = 0 , (9.59)
The normal force from the ground on the car is therefore N = mg.
Because the car drives at constant speed, the acceleration in the tangential direction
along the road (the y-direction) is zero:
∑ F y = f y = ma y = 0 , (9.60)
Therefore the y-component of the friction force is zero.
Since the car follows a circular path, the car is accelerated in the normal direction,
in toward the center of the circle. This corresponds to the −x direction in Fig. 9.13.
Since the car is driving with a speed v, the normal acceleration corresponds to the
centripetal acceleration of an object moving in a circle of radius R:
∑ Fx = f x = ma x = m
(
− v2
R
)
, (9.61)
9.3 Circular Motion 253
The friction force from the road on the car is therefore:
f = −m v2
R . (9.62)
However, we know that the maximum absolute value of the static friction force is
fmax = μs N , (9.63)
(Notice that we use the static friction force model here because the car is not slipping).
If the friction force f in (9.62) required to make the car follow the circular path
exceeds the maximum static friction force, it means that our initial assumption that
the motion is constrained fails and the car cannot follow a circular path. The car
starts sliding at the velocity vm when the static friction force f in (9.62) is equal to
the maximum static friction force:
∣
∣
∣
∣−m v2
m
R
∣
∣
∣
∣ = μs N ⇒ v2
m = μs g R ⇒ vm = √μs g R . (9.64)
This means that as long as the friction force is smaller than fmax the car is able to
follow the circular path. But if the friction force exceeds the static friction force,
the car can no longer follow the circular path. Instead, it starts sliding and follows a
non-circular path, which can also be found from Newton’s second law. Sliding starts
at a particular speed, vm . For speeds below this, the car is able to follow the curve.
9.3.2 Example: Pendulum with Air Resistance
In this example we will address the motion of a pendulum with air resistance. The
pendulum is a classic problem in mechanics, which can be solved analytically, but
with the added complication of air resistance, we need to resort to numerical methods.
Problem: The pendulum consists of a ball of mass m attached to a massless rope of
length L. The other end of the rope is attached to the ceiling as illustrated in Fig. 9.14.
The ball starts at the bottom-most position with an initial velocity v0 . Find the motion
of the pendulum with and without air resistance and discuss the differences. What
initial velocity is needed for the ball to make a complete circle?
Approach: First, we will find the motion of the ball, assuming that the ball follows
a circular pat, using Newton’s second law. We will find the motion without air resis-
tance analytically, and use this analytical solution to test a more general numerical
method. The numerical model can be used to find the initial velocity needed to make
a complete circle.
Identify: Our basic assumption is that the ball is constrained to follow a circular
path. The position of the ball is measured by the distance s(t) measured along the
254 9 Forces and Constrained Motion

a pendulum. Right Free-body
diagram of the pendulum ball
circle, starting at zero at the bottom of the circle. However, we will need to check
the validity of this constraint to check that the conditions for the ball following the
circular path are satisfied at all times. We can also describe s(t) by the angle, θ(t),
formed with the vertical as illustrated in Fig. 9.14. The arc length, s(t), measured
along the circle is relate to the angle, θ(t) measured in radians, by s(t) = Lθ(t).
Model: The ball is in contact with the rope and the surrounding air, giving rise to the
force from the rope on the ball, the rope tension, T, and the air drag, FD . In addition,
the ball is subject to the force from gravity, G.
The forces are illustrated in Fig. 9.14 when the ball is at a position s(t) corre-
sponding to an angle θ(t). We decompose the forces using a local coordinate system
with unit vectors ˆu T and ˆu N tangential and normal to the path respectively.
Trigonometrical decomposition: We may decompose the forces in two ways. Either
we may examine the geometry in Fig. 9.14 and see that G x = G sin θ and G y =
G cos θ, and therefore
G = −mg sin θ ˆu T − mg cos θ ˆu N . (9.65)
Unit vector decomposition: Alternatively, we can find ˆu T and ˆu N expressed using
θ, and use these to decompose the vectors using the dot product. From Fig. 9.14 we
see ˆu N , is directed towards the center of the circle, and that the tangential vector is
normal to the normal vector:
ˆu N = − sin θ i + cos θ j , ˆu T = cos θ i + sin θ j . (9.66)
From these expressions and G = −mg j we find
G T = G · ˆu T = −mg sin θ , G N = G · ˆu N = −mg cos θ , (9.67)
just as we found above. This method is more mathematical, less intuitive, but more
robust—it always works if you are able to write down the unit vectors.
9.3 Circular Motion 255
Air resistance model: We assume that we may use a quadratic law for the air
resistance:
FD = −Dv v = −D|v(t)|v(t) ˆu T , (9.68)
where we have used that v = v(t) ˆu T . Notice that ˆu T points in the positive rotational
direction and that v(t) may be positive and negative depending on the direction of
motion.
String tension: The string tension acts in the normal direction: T = T ˆu N .
Newton’s second law: Newton’s second law for the ball gives:
∑ F = T + FD + G = m a . (9.69)
We decompose the acceleration in a tangential and a normal component (from
Chap. 8):
a = dv
dt ˆu T + v2
ρ ˆu N , (9.70)
where ρ = L is the radius of the circle. The net force on component form is:
∑ F = T ˆu N − Dv|v| ˆu T − mg sin θ ˆu T − mg cos θ ˆu N = dv
dt ˆu T + v2
ρ ˆu N . (9.71)
The normal component of this equation is
T − mg cos θ = m
(
v2/L
)
⇒ T = mg cos θ + m
(
v2/L
)
. (9.72)
This allows us to calculate T given the velocity v(t) and the angle θ(t). The condition
for circular motion is that T is positive, since the rope can only pull and not push
at the ball. If T < 0 our assumptions break down and the ball no longer follows a
circular path.
In the tangential direction we get:
m dv
dt = −Dv|v| − mg sin θ = −Dv|v| − mg sin s(t)
L , (9.73)
where we have inserted θ = s(t)/L. This gives us an equation of motion, just like
we have found before, that we must now solve.
Solve: We want to find the position s(t) as a function of time from (9.73). The initial
conditions for the ball is that at the time t0 = 0 s the ball is at s(t0) = 0 m, and the
initial velocity is v(t0) = v0 .
256 9 Forces and Constrained Motion
Analytical solution: This problem can be solved when there is no air drag (D = 0)
and s(t)  L. We can then approximate sin(s/L)  (s/L), 3 giving the equation of
motion
d2s
dt2 = −g sin s(t)
L  − g
L s , (9.74)
which we recognize as the equation for harmonic motion, which we solved in
Sect. 5.7. The general solution is
s(t) = A cos ωt + B sin ωt , (9.75)
which is confined by the initial condition s(0) = 0 m/s, which gives that A = 0, and
v(0) = Bω = v0 , which gives B = v0/ω The solution is therefore
s(t) = v0
ω sin ωt , (9.76)
where we find ω by inserting s(t) from (9.76) into (9.74), giving ω2 = g/L. The
solution describes a periodic motion with period T = 2π/ω = 2π(L/g)1/2 .
For small deviations and without air resistance, the pendulum will therefore oscil-
late back-and-forth with a period given by gravity and the length of the pendulum: A
well know result from mechanics. We can use this simplified result to test our more
general solution to the problem found below.
Numerical solution: The solution for small values of s is not relevant if we want to
understand how far the ball can be swung. Instead, we must solve the equation of
motion numerically. The differential equation of motion is:
d2s
dt2 = − D
m v(t)|v(t)| − g sin s(t)
L . (9.77)
with initial conditions s(0) = 0 and v(0) = v0 . In addition, we need to check that the
rope tension remains positive, since our solution breaks down if this is not true. Using
T from (9.72) the condition for rope tension is T (t) = mv2/L + mg cos(s/L) ≥ 0.
Let us now address a specific pendulum with a ball of mass 0.5 kg, the rope has
a length of L = 1 m, and the drag coefficient is C D = 0.04 kg/m, and v0 = 2 m/s.
We solve the equations of motion numerically using Euler-Cromer’s method in the
following program:
from pylab import *
g = 9.8 # m/sˆ2
dt = 0.01 # s
time = 10.0 # s
v0 = 2.0 # s
D = 0.05 #
L = 1.0 # m
3 The result sin u  u when u  1 is a result of a first order Taylor expansion.

v = zeros(n,float)
T = zeros(n,float)
# Initial conditions
v[0] = v0
s[0] = 0.0
# Simulation loop
i = 0
while (i<n AND T[i]>=0.0):
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
a = -D/m*v[i]*abs(v[i])-g*sin(s[i]/L)
v[i+1] = v[i] + a*dt
s[i+1] = s[i] + v[i+1]*dt
T[i+1] = m*v[i+1]ˆ**/L + m*g*cos(s[i+1]/L)
i = i + 1
Rope tension T is calculated at every time step, and the simulation is stopped if the
tension becomes negative. This does not mean that the motion of the pendulum stops
if tension becomes negative, but the motion is no longer described by the equation
of motion in (9.77). Instead the ball will fall until the rope again becomes tight, and
the ball bounces about in the rope until it comes to rest or starts swinging back and
forth.
Results: The result of the simulation is shown in Fig. 9.15. The pendulum oscillates
with a relatively small deflection, corresponding to small values of s. The damping
due to air resistance is clearly evident. However, the damping becomes less dom-
inating for smaller velocities, because the damping term depends on square of the
velocity, F D ∝ v2 . If we turn air drag off completely, we can compare the numerical
solution to the analytical solution in order to test our numerical model.

Discussion: What happens if we increase the initial velocity, v0 ? We expect the
pendulum to continue all the way around the circle. However, we need to ensure that
the rope tension, T , remains positive.
First, we turn air resistance off. We give the pendulum an initial angular velocity,
and see if it goes all the way round. We start from v0 = 5 m/s. Here, the pendulum
ball falls down at s = 1.76 m, which corresponds to θ = 1.76 m/1.0 m  0.54π.
Increasing v0 to 10 m/s allows the pendulum to go all the way round without falling
down, and the pendulum continues to rotate in the vertical plane. The two paths are
illustrated in Fig. 9.16.
We may now use our program to find the maximum angle, θ∗, reached by the
pendulum—that is the angle at which the pendulum falls down—as a function of
the initial velocity: θ∗(v0). When there is no air drag, we can solve this problem
analytically using energy conservation methods, but with air drag, there is no simple
analytical solution, and our numerical study would be the only practical solution.
Test your understanding: What happens when θ > 2π in Fig. 9.16?
Summary
Linearly constrained motion:
• An object is linearly constrained if it is forced to follow a straight line.
• Choose the T -axis along the motion, and N -axis normal to the motion.
• Decompose forces in the T and N directions.
• Set a N = 0. Use Newton’s second law to find the forces in the N -direction.
• Apply Newton’s second law to find acceleration in the T -direction.
9.3 Circular Motion 259
Friction force model:
• Friction forces are tangential forces at the contact between two objects.
• The friction force may depend on the normal forces at the contact.
• If the two objects in contact are not moving relative to each other, the friction
force f is limited by f m = μs N , where μs is the coefficient of static friction.
• If the two objects in contact are moving relative to each other, the friction force
f is f = μd N , where μd is the coefficient of dynamic friction. The friction force
acts against the relative movement of the objects.
Curved motion:
• Objects constrained to follow a curved path has an acceleration normal to the path
given by the centripetal acceleration a N = v2/R.
• The net force in the direction normal to the curve is therefore always non-zero
for curved motion!

9.16 Stick-slip friction. In this project we will study a phenomenon called stick-
slip friction. If you pull a block along a flat table with a soft spring, you will find that
the block does not move continuously with a constant velocity, instead it moves in
small jumps. This intermittent motion is called stick-slip friction, and it is the origin
of the high-frequency vibrating tone you often hear from wheels that are not well

lubricated. It is also one of the basic mechanisms leading to the wide distribution of
earthquake sizes.
Here, we will introduce and study a model for stick-slip friction for a block pulled
by a spring sliding over a flat, horizontal surface, as illustrated in Fig. 9.18.
The block has mass m. A massless spring (with spring constant k and equilibrium
length b) is attached to the block at the point x. The free end (the right-hand end in
Fig. 9.18) of the spring is at the point x b. We move x b, the free end of the spring,
with a constant velocity u. The static and dynamic coefficients of friction for the
contact between the block and the bottom surface are μs and μd respectively. The
acceleration of gravity is g = 9.8 m/s 2 .
The block starts at the position x(t0) = 0 at the time t0 = 0. The position x b of
the free end of the spring is x b(t0) = x(t0) + b at t0 .
(a) Draw a free-body diagram for the block.
(b) Find the position of the spring attachment point x b(t) as a function of time.
(c) Show that the force, F on the block from the spring is F = k(x b − x − b)i.
Stationary state: First, let us characterize the stationary state, where the block is
moving at a constant velocity.
(d) Identify the forces acting on the block and draw a free-body diagram for the
block in the stationary state.
(e) Introduce force models for all the forces acting on the block. Find the normal
force, N , on the block.
(f) Find the acceleration of the block in the stationary state.
(g) Find the elongation ΔL of the spring in the stationary state.
(h) Find the position x(t) of the block as a function of time in the stationary state.
Starting from rest: Let us now address the situation where the block starts from rest.
That is, we assume that the block starts at x(t0) = 0 m with v(t0) = 0 m/s at the time
t0 = 0 s.
(i) Identify the force acting on the block and draw a free-body diagram of the block
before the block starts moving. Introduce force models for all the forces.
9.3 Circular Motion 263
(j) Find the elongation ΔL of the spring at the instant the block starts moving.
(k) Assume that the block starts at rest. Find the friction force on the block as a
function of time in the period before the block starts moving. Sketch the friction
force as a function of time until some time after the block has started moving.
(l) Show that the acceleration of the block immediately after it starts moving is
a = (k/m) (x b − x − b) − μd g. Explain why you cannot use this relation for the
acceleration to determine the subsequent motion of the block.
General motion: Now, we will develop a general method to find the motion, x(t), of
the block. First, we study the case when u = 0 m/s and the coefficients of friction
are zero, μs = μd = 0.
(m) Find an expression for the horizontal acceleration of the block. Show that x(t) =
(v0/ω) sin ωt, where ω = (k/m)1/2 , when v(0) = v0 .
(n) Write a numerical algorithm to find the position and velocity of the block at a
time ti + Δt, x(ti + Δt) and v(ti + Δt), given the position and velocity of the block
at a time ti , x(ti ) and v(ti ).
(o) Implement the numerical algorithm in a program to find the position of the block
as a function of time for m = 0.1 kg, k = 100 N/m, b = 0.1 m and v0 = 0.1 m/s.
Plot the behavior for a simulation of 2 s, and compare the result of your program
with exact solution. Ensure that you choose a time-step Δt the reproduces the exact
solution with sufficient accuracy. What happens if you choose a too large time-step
Δt?
Let us now address the situation when the block is pulled at a finite velocity, u.
(p) Modify your program to find the position of the block when u = 0.1m/s and the
block starts at rest. In this case, the exact solution is:
x(t) = ut − u
ω sin ωt . (9.78)
Compare your result with the exact solution by plotting both the simulated x and the
exact x in the same plot.
General motion with friction: Finally, we address the full complexity of the situation,
and introduce non-zero friction forces.
(q) Modify your program to include friction using μs = 0.6, μd = 0.3. Show a plot
of x(t) for m = 0.1 kg and for m = 1.0 kg.
(r) Plot the spring force F on the block as a function of time for both values of m
and explain the differences.
(s) What happens if you instead decrease k to k = 10 N for m = 0.1 kg. Can you
explain the behavior?
9.17 Feather in tornado. In this project you will learn to use Newton’s laws and
the force model for air resistance in a wind field to address the motion of a light
object in strong winds. We start from a simple model without wind and gradually
add complexity to the model, until we finally address the motion in a tornado.
Motion without wind: First, we address the motion of the feather without wind.
(a) Identify the forces acting on a feather while it is falling and draw a free-body
diagram for the feather.
264 9 Forces and Constrained Motion
(b) Introduce quantitative force models for the forces, and find an expression for the
acceleration of the feather. You may assume a quadratic law for air resistance.
(c) If you release the feather from rest, its velocity will tend asymptotically toward
the terminal velocity, v T . Show that the terminal velocity is v T = −(mg/D)1/2 ,
where D is the constant in the air resistance model.
(d) We release the feather from a distance h above the floor and measure the time t
until the feather hits the floor. You may assume that the feather falls with a constant
velocity equal to the terminal velocity. Show how you can determine D/mg by
measuring the time t. Estimate D/mg when you release the feather from a height of
2.4 m above the floor and it takes 4.8 s until it hits the floor.
(e) We will now develop a more precise model where we do not assume that the
velocity is constant. You release the feather from the height h at the time t = 0 s.
Find the equation you have to solve to find the position of the feather as a function
of time. What are the initial conditions?
(f) Write a program that solves this equation to find the velocity and position as a
function of time t. Use the parameters you determined above, and test the program
by ensuring that it produces the correct terminal velocity.
(g) Fig. 9.19 shows the position and velocity calculated with the program using the
parameters found above. Was the approximation in part (d) reasonable? Explain your
answer.
Model with wind: We have now found a model that can be used to find the motion
of the feather. We will now find the motion of the feather in three dimensions while
it is blowing. The velocity of the wind varies in space, so that the wind velocity w is
a function of the position r. We write this as w = w(r).
(h) Find an expression for the acceleration of the feather. The expression may include
the wind velocity w(r). Let the z-axis correspond to the vertical direction.
(i) Assume that the feather is moving in an approximately horizontal plane—that is
you may assume that the vertical acceleration is negligible. How does the wind have

Motion in a tornado: For a tornado with a center at the origin, the wind velocity is
expected to be approximately given by the model:
w(r) = u0re−r/R ˆuθ = u0 (−y, x, 0) e−r/R , (9.79)
where u0 is a characteristic velocity for the wind, R is the radius of the tornado,
and ˆuθ is a tangential unit vector in the horizontal plane ( ˆuθ is normal to r). Here,
r = (x, y, z), and r = |r|. The velocity field is illustrated in Fig. 9.20.
(j) Is is possible to choose an appropriate set of initial conditions so that the feather
moves in a circular path in the tornado? Explain your answer.
(k) Rewrite your program to find the velocity and position of the feather as a function
of time. For the tornado you may use the values u0 = 100 m/s and R = 20 m.
(l) Find the trajectory for the feather if it is released from rest from a height of 2.4m,
and in a position corresponding to r = −R i + hk.
(m) The trajectory of the feather is shown in Figs. 9.20 and 9.21. Compare the results
with what happended when you dropped the feather without wind. Why does the
feather now take longer to reach the ground?
9.18 Modelling Atomic Interactions. In this project we will create a model for
an atom with mass m in the vicinity of two large molecules. We will assume that
the molecules are massive and do not move. We will first look at a one-dimensional

(h) Make a plot of two distinct x(t) from t = 0 ns to t = 10 ns, the first from a running
of the program with the initial conditions x0 = d and v0 = 0.5 m/s, and the other
from a running of the program with the initial conditions x0 = d and v0 = 1.5 m/s.
Make another plot of v(t) for the same initial conditions.

(m) Can you choose initial conditions r0 and v0 in such a manner that the atom
moves in a circular orbit with a constant radius? If so, what initial conditions are
those? Plot the motion for these conditions.
Chapter 10
Work
How can you find the motion of an atom moving near a surface according to a
complicated position-dependent force without solving Newton’s equation?
Up to now, you have learned to use Newton’s laws of motion to determine the
motion of an object based on the forces acting on it. The methods you have learned
are completely general and can always be applied to solve a problem. Unfortunately,
in many cases we cannot find an exact solution to the equations of motion we get
from Newton’s second law.
Here we introduce a commonly used technique that allows us to find the velocity as
a function of position without finding the position as a function of time—an alternate
form of Newton’s second law. The method is based on a simple principle: Instead of
solving the equations of motion directly, we integrate the equations of motion. Such
a method is called an integration method. You will learn two integration methods:
In this chapter we integrate Newton’s second law in space using the work-energy
theorem to find the speed as a function of position; in Chap. 12 we integrate Newton’s
second law in time to get conservation of momentum. While these methods are simple
from a mathematical point of view, they introduce very important physical concepts
that you will rely on throughout your career. You should therefore pay more attention
to the use of these methods than to their derivation.
In this chapter, we introduce the work-energy theorem as a method to find the
velocity as a function of position for an object even in cases when we cannot solve the
equations of motion. This introduces us to the concept of work and kinetic energy—
an energy related to the motion of an object. Finally we also address the rate of work
done by a force—the power.
10.1 Integration Methods
In principle, we can determine the motion of any object if we know the net force,
Fnet acting on the object, by applying Newton’s second law:
m a = Fnet(r, v, t) . (10.1)

270 10 Work
and solve to the position at a time t, r(t), if we start from r(t0). Since (10.1) is true,
the integral of this equation must also be valid for the motion. Integral, you ask, what
integral? Both the integral over time and the integral over the actual motion—the
curve integral along the motion. The following two integrals of (10.1) also describe
the motion: ∫ t
t0
m a dt =
∫ t
t0
Fnet(r, v, t) dt , (10.2)
∫
C
a · dr =
∫
C
Fnet(r, v, t) · dr . (10.3)
Ok. This may be true, but it seems entirely unmotivated. Why would we want to do
this? Bear with us. It turns out that both these integrals are very useful and introduce
powerful new concepts. In this chapter, we will focus on the integral in (10.3), while
in the next chapter we focus on (10.2).
Path Integral
To understand the motivation, let us look at the integral in (10.3) in detail and calculate
the left-hand side. What does the integral in (10.3) mean? It is the path integral along
the curve, r(t). However, this integral may depend not only on the path, but also on
how we move along the path—it may depend on the velocity v(t) along the curve.
We should therefore replace the dr with (dr/dt)dt on both sides of the equation.
The equation is still true since it is simply an integral of Newton’s second law:
∫ t
t0
m a · dr
dt dt =
∫ t
t0
Fnet(r, v, t) · dr
dt dt . (10.4)
Again, you may ask why this is useful. The short answer is that it is useful because
we always can find the analytical solution to the left-hand side and we sometimes can
find the solution to the right-hand side, even if we cannot find the analytical solution
to the acceleration from Newton’s second law.
What is the left-hand side of (10.4)? It can be solved using integration by parts:
∫ t
t0
m a · dr
dt dt =
∫ t
t0
m dv
dt · v dt = v · v −
∫ t
t0
v · dv
dt dt , (10.5)
which gives
∫ t
t0
m a · dr
dt dt = 1
2 mv · v . (10.6)
The left-hand side of (10.4) therefore only depends on the magnitude of the velocity!
We can therefore find the change in velocity, if we only can calculate the integral
on the right-hand side of (10.4). The resulting integral equation is called the Work-
energy theorem:
10.1 Integration Methods 271
Work-energy theorem: For any motion r(t), we can find the change in veloc-
ities from the integral W0,1 :

Application of the Work-Energy Theorem
The power of the work-energy theorem is best demonstrated by an example. For an
atom moving along a surface, as shown in Fig. 10.1, the force from the surface on
the atom can ba approximated as:
F(x) = −F0 sin 2π x
b , (10.8)
where x is the position of the atom and b is the distance between the atoms on the
surface. If we apply Newton’s second law to find the motion of the atom, we get
∑ Fx = F(x) = −F0 sin 2π x
b = ma ⇒ a = − F0
m sin 2π x
b , (10.9)
which we can solve numerically, but not analytically. However, we can use the Work-
energy integral to find the velocity as a function of position for this motion. We
calculate the work integral

where the sign depends on what direction the atom is moving in. This expression is a
complete solution of the motion. Figure 10.1 illustrates the numerical solution for x(t)
and v(t) for various initial velocities and positions, and the corresponding plot of v(x).
We have plotted the analytical solution on top using circles. Notice the interesting
pattern in this figure. We will spend more time developing our understanding of this
model further on.
10.2 Work-Energy Theorem
The work-energy theorem is an alternative form of Newton’s second law and therefore
has the same range of applicability. We call the path integral along the curve the work
of the net force:
W net
0,1 =
∫ t1
t0
Fnet(r, v, t) · v dt . (10.14)
But this definitions seems to require that we know the both r(t) and v(t) in order to
solve the integral. Hmmmm. Was not the whole point that we did need to find the
analytical solution?
The usefulness of the formulation first comes to its right when the net force
depends on the position only—that is, when the net force does not depend on the
velocity:
W net
0,1 =
∫ t1
t0
Fnet(r) · v dt =
∫
C
Fnet(r) · dr . (10.15)
In this case, we may be able to solve the integral, as we saw above, even if we
cannot solve to find the motion. This gives the work-energy theorem for a position-
10.2 Work-Energy Theorem 273
dependent force:
W net
0,1 =
∫
C
Fnet(r) · dr = 1
2 mv2 − 1
2 mv2
0 . (10.16)
This equation has an even simpler form in one dimension when F = Fi and dr = dx,
giving
W net
0,1 =
∫ x
x0
F(x) dx = 1
2 mv2 − 1
2 mv2
0 . (10.17)
It is usual to introduce the term kinetic energy, K , for the right-hand side in the
work-energy theorem
K = 1
2 mv2 . (10.18)
This is the reason why we call the theorem the work-energy theorem. And we can
now formulate it very compactly:
W net
0,1 = K1 − K0 . (10.19)
Where it is usual to drop the subindex 0, 1 for the work.
Unit of work: The unit for work is Joule (J), which is defined as: 1 J (Joule) =
1 Nm = 1 kgm 2/s 2 .
Comments on the Work-Energy Theorem
The work-energy theorem has several important features:
• The work-energy theorem is an alternative formulation of Newton’s second law
of motion, and is therefore valid as long as Newton’s laws are valid. For example,
it is only valid in an inertial system. It is not valid in an accelerated coordinate
system.
• The work-energy is only true if you find the work of the net force. Do not forget
or leave out any of the forces acting on the object.
• Notice that most microscopic laws of motion, including all interatomic interac-
tions, only depend on position. The same is true for gravitational forces between
astronomical objects. There is a large span of processes where the net force is only
position dependent. The special formulation in (10.17) is therefore a very useful
law.
For example, if you take a block and pull it back and forth a few times on the floor,
you cannot use (10.17) to find the work because both the friction force from the floor
on the block and the driving force (you pulling or pushing the block) varies not only
274 10 Work
with position, but also with time and velocity. After pushing the block back and forth
you end up at the same place. If you used (10.17), the work would therefore be zero,
which is incorrect. You have performed work on the block even if the block ends in
the same place it started.
Superposition of Work
The work-energy theorem is only valid for the work done by the net force. If there
are several forces acting on an object, we may number the forces F j from j = 1 to
j = n. The net force is the sum of the forces:
Fnet = ∑
j
F j , (10.20)
The work done by the net force can therefore be written as:
W net =
∫ t1
t0
Fnet ·v dt =
∫ t1
t0
∑
j
F j ·v dt = ∑
j
∫ t1
t0
F j ·v dt = ∑
j
W j . (10.21)
where W j is the work done by force j. The work done by the net force is therefore
the sum of the work done by each of the forces acting. For a one-dimensional motion
with a position-dependent force, F = F(x) i this simplifies to:
W j =
∫ t1
t0
F j · v dt =
∫ x
x0
F(x) dx . (10.22)
The Concept of Work
I am sure you have an intuition of what physical work is, but does that correspond to
our definition of mechanical work? Intuitively, it requires work to push a box along
the floor. The longer we push, the more work it requires. The heavier the box (and
hence the larger the friction force), the more work is done. Here, our intuition is
consistent with our definition.
However, if you lift a box from the floor, it requires work. Both in the ordinary use
of the word and in our precise definition. But I am sure you know that just holding
a heavy box in your arms requires effort, although it requires no work according to
our definition. Trying to push a very heavy box without succeeding also requires
no mechanical work, but still requires effort on your behalf. The reasons for this
discrepancy are related to how we perceive and experience trying to move something,
to how our muscles work inside our bodies, and to how we perceive movement: your
10.2 Work-Energy Theorem 275
body may still move somewhat while the box is kept approximately at a constant
height.
However, a mechanical analysis of the work done when you move your body is
useful, and does result in real effects that you can feel. It is, for example, possible
to design a backpack that requires less effort to carry long distances based on our
understanding of work (and energy conservation).
Most importantly, it is important to try to separate the very precise definition of
mechanical work from the looser concept from everyday speech.
10.3 Work Done by One-Dimensional Force Models
We apply the work-energy theorem to various force models, such as a constant force,
a spring force, and a given position-dependent force—all in one dimension.
Work of a Constant Force
The work done by a constant force, F = F0 , as a car accelerates/decelerates from
x0 to x1 is
W =
∫ t1
t0
F0 v dt =
∫ x1
x0
F0 dx = F0 (x1 − x0) = Fx Δx . (10.23)
If the force F0 is the only force (or the net force) on the car, the work W corresponds
to the change in kinetic energy.
• Notice that if the force and the displacement, Δx, are in the same direction, the
work is positive. If this is the net force, it means that the kinetic energy increases,
and that the speed increases.
• If the force and the displacement are in opposite direction, for example if the car
is moving in the positive x-direction while it is breaking with a constant force in
the negative x-direction, the work is negative. If this is the net force on the car,
the kinetic energy decreases and the speed decreases.
Work of a Spring Force
One of the most commonly used models for a contact force is the spring model. What
is the work done by a spring force? Figure 10.2 illustrates the motion of a block on a
frictionless horizontal surface. The block is attached to a spring with spring constant
k. The other end of the spring is attached at the origin, x = 0, and the equilibrium
length of the spring is L0 . The force, Fx , from the spring on the block is then:

The position, x, where the spring force is zero is called the equilibrium position.
Here, the equilibrium position is x = L0 .
The work done by the spring force on the block as the block moves from x(t0) = x0
to x(t1) = x1 is:
W0,1 =

−ku du = 1
2 k(x0 − L0)2 − 1
2 k(x1 − L0)2 . (10.26)
This result becomes simpler if we move the origin to the equilibrium position of the
spring, as shown in Fig. 10.2c, so that F(x) = −kx. The work from x0 to x1 is then

Work of a Position-Dependent Force
The work of a position-dependent force F(x) is found through the integral
W =
∫ x
x0
F(x) dx . (10.28)
This force F(x) may be a simple function, such as F(x) = −kx or F(x) =
F0 sin 2π x/b. In that case you can simply solve the integral analytically. But what if
you cannot solve the integral analytically or the function F(x) is not know exactly,
but instead is measured in a discrete number of points, x i . How can you then find the
work?
Symbolic Integration of a Function F(x)
Even if you cannot (or you are too lazy to) solve the integral analytically, you can
always check if Python can the indefinite integral symbolically. We demonstrate this
for a force F(x) = 1/(a + x2) for x > 0. We integrate this function using the
symbolic package in Python as follows:
>> from sympy import *
>> a = Symbol(’a’, real=True, positive=True)
>> x = Symbol(’x’)
>> integrate(1/(a+x**2),x)
atan(x/sqrt(a))/sqrt(a)
Numerical Integration of a Function F(x)
However, if we cannot find an analytical solution to the integral of F(x), we can
always calculate the definite integral numerically. The integral from x0 to x1 of F(x)
in Fig. 10.3 corresponds to the area under the curve from x0 to x1 . We can calculate
the area by first dividing the interval into smaller pieces, finding an approximate value
for the area of each such piece, and summing the areas to find total area corresponding
to the integral.
We divide the interval from x0 to x1 into n intervals of length Δx = (x1 − x0)/n
so that interval i spans from x i to x i+1 = x i + Δ. (See Fig. 10.3). The area under the
curve F(x) over the interval from x i to x i+1 is the integral:
Wi,i+1 =
∫ x i+1
x i
F(x) dx . (10.29)
When Δx is small, the area under the curve is approximately equal to the area of a
rectangle of width Δx and a height given by the value of F(x) at x i , as illustrated in
Fig. 10.3b. The area of this rectangle is Wi,i+1 = A i  Δx F(x i ), and the total area
is the sum of all the areas A i , i = 1, . . . , n as illustrated in Fig. 10.3b:
W0,1 =

numerical integral with half the box width, Δx/2. d The numerical integral as a sum of trapezoids
This approach is identical to Euler’s method from Chap. 4. As we increase the number
of intervals n, the numerical approximation becomes better and better. Figure 10.3c
shows how the area of the rectangles becomes a better approximation to the area
under the curve when n is doubled. We expect that our approximation approaches
the exact value for the integral as n increases. 1 While Euler’s method is simple to
explain, we can obtain a better approximation by using trapeziods with corners F(x i )
and F(x i+1). The area of one such trapezoid is the baseline Δx multiplied by the
average height h i :
Wi,i+1 = A i  Δx h i = Δx 1

10.3 Work Done by One-Dimensional Force Models 279
This method is called the trapezoidal rule for numerical integration. The numerical
implementation of this method is just as simple as Euler’s method.
The trapezoidal rule is a standard numerical integration method that is built into
Python through the function trapz. For example, we can integrate the work done
by the function F(x) shown in Fig. 10.3a:
Fx (x) = 3xe−0.7 x , (10.33)
from x0 = 0.5 m to x1 = 5 m in n = 1000 steps by: first generating a set of n x i
values; then generating the corresponding set of F(x i ) values; and finally calculating
the integral using trapz:
xval = linspace(0.5,5.0,1000)
y = 3.0*xval*exp(-0.7*xval)
W = trapz(y,x=xval)
(Notice that the integral of this particular function F(x) is analytically solvable. We
have used it here to illustrate the principle of how to solve an integral numerically).
Numerical Integration of a Measured F(x i )
In some case, the force F(x) may be the result of a more complicated calculation
or it may be an experimentally measured value. For example, you may calculate the
net force on a basketball bouncing on the floor using an advanced model for the
deformation of the surface of the ball; you may calculate the forces between two
atoms as a function of their position based on an underlying microscopic picture
such as quantum mechanics; or you may measure the force as a function of position
as you pull on the string of your bow. In all these cases you know the force F(x i )
for some values x i , but you do not know the general function F(x).
How can we estimate the work integral based on a few points? One approach
would be to try to find a smooth function F(x) that goes through all the points, and
then use this function to calculate the work numerically. This is a powerful method,
but beyond the scope of this text. Another method is to apply the trapezoidal rule
on the discrete data as an approximation to the integral, as illustrated in Fig. 10.4.
Fortunately, the trapezoidal rule is so robust that we may apply it also in cases when
the data is not uniformly spaced—that is, when the intervals Δx i = x i+1 − x i vary.
In this case, we approximate the integral from x0 to x1 by the sum:
W0,1 =
∫ x1
x0
F(x) dx 
n∑
i=1
Δx i
1
2
[F(x i ) + F(x i+1)] . (10.34)
This method works for both calculated and measured values of F(x i ), and has exactly
the same implementation as above. For example, given a file forcedata.d2 consisting
of lines with values of x i and F(x i ), we can read the data and calculate the work
integral by:

10.3.1 Example: Jumping from the Roof
In this example you will be introduced to how to apply the work-energy problem to
solve actual problems, applying it to a constant force and a spring force.
You are standing on top of your house and are wondering how to jump down
without getting hurt: You can jump into a thick snow cover, which exhibits a constant
force, or onto a trampoline, which exhibits a spring force. What alternative would
exert the smallest force?
Specify the problem: This problem is formulated loosely on purpose. You should
be able to address such problems by adding the necessary components yourself. Let
us make the problem more specific by adding details and assumptions: You have a
mass m and your roof is a height h above the ground. You stop after a distance d.
Also, we neglect air resistance.
10.3 Work Done by One-Dimensional Force Models 281
Sketch: The problem addresses the motion of a person falling through air and then
into various materials. We use y(t) for the vertical position and place the origin at
the top of the cushion with positive direction upward as shown in Fig. 10.5.
Model: We divide the motion into two phases, as illustrated in Fig. 10.5. Just like
when we solve problems using Newton’s second law, we start by analyzing the forces
acting on the object.
Phase 1: The person falls through air from y0 = h to y1 = 0. The only force acting
is gravity, G y = −mg.
Phase 2: The person is in contact with the surface from y1 = 0 to y2 = −d.
There is a contact force from the surface, F acting upward in the positive
y-direction and gravity, G y = −mg.
Applying the work-energy theorem: We could now use Newton’s second law to
find the position y(t) as a function of time. We know this would work, but it is a lot
of work.
However, in this case, we do not care about the time it takes for the person to fall
from the house and then brake during contact with the surface. We only care about
the velocity immediately before contact with the surface, and the distance he needs
to stop while in contact with the surface: We are only interested in questions relating
the velocity v y to the position y: First, what is the velocity when y = 0? Second,
what is the position y when the velocity is zero, that is, when you have stopped?
(Ok, this is not really the question. We actually want to find the force F necessary to
ensure that the velocity is zero after a length d into the surface, but this is essentially
the same as finding the distance d it moves before the velocity is zero when affected
by a force F).
Fig. 10.5 A person jumping from the roof into various braking “devices”
282 10 Work
Our plan is to use the work-energy theorem for the first phase to find the velocity
immediately before you hit the surface, expressed as a function of the height, h, you
jumped from. We will then use the work-energy theorem for the second phase to find
the distance d you move before you stop, expressed in terms of the velocity you had
when you hit the surface. Finally, we will relate the stopping distance d to the initial
height h, and then find the maximum force during phase two.
Finding the velocity before impact: In Phase 1 the net force is constant: Fnet
y =
−mg. We find the change in velocity from y0 to y1 using the work-energy theorem:
K1 − K0 = W0,1 , where the work of the net force from y0 to y1 is:
W0,1 =
∫ t1
t0
Fnet
y vdt =
∫ y1
y0
(−mg) dy = −mg (y1 − y0) = mgh , (10.35)
where we have used that y1 = 0 and y0 = h. This is equal to the change in kinetic
energy:
W0,1 = mgh = K1 − K0 = 1
2 mv2
1 − 1
2 mv2
0 = 1
2 mv2
1 = K1 . (10.36)
where we have used that the person starts from rest, v0 = 0 m/s. This gives that
K1 = mgh, which is what we will need to determine the stop length, d.
Contact with the surface: In Phase 2 the net force is:
Fnet
y = F − mg , (10.37)
where the force F from the surface depends on the nature of the surface. We will
therefore treat the various surfaces independently.
Falling into snow—Constant force model: For snow, we assume that F is a constant
force. We use the work-energy theorem W1,2 = K2 − K1 to relate the stopping
distance d to the kinetic energy K1 when the contact started. The work of the net
force over the distance Δy = y2 − y1 = 0 − d = −d is:
W1,2 =
∫ y2
y1
(F − mg) dy = (F − mg) (−d) = K2 − K1 . (10.38)
where K2 = 0 sice the person stops at y2 . We insert K1 from (10.36), getting:
− (F − mg) d = −K1 = −mgh ⇒ F − mg = mg h
d ⇒ F = mg
(
1 + h
d
)
.
(10.39)
Falling into snow—Discussion: Notice the simplicity of this approach. We do not
even have to calculate the velocity v1 after the person has fallen a height h.
For a typical house of 6 m height and for a typical person of height 2 m and a
stopping distance of 1 m, the force from the snow is F = mg (1 + 6) = 7mg.
10.3 Work Done by One-Dimensional Force Models 283
The work integral during the free fall is illustrated as the blue area in Fig. 10.6,
and the work integral during contact is illustrated as the red area. After the free fall,
the person has a kinetic energy corresponding to the blue area. Similarly, the red area
corresponds to the change in kinetic energy during contact. The person stops when
the red area is equal to the blue area. Notice that the fall starts on the right hand side
of Fig. 10.6, which corresponds to high y-values, and then progresses toward the left.
This graph can be a useful tool to discuss the motion.
Test your understanding: Based on Fig. 10.6 and that you stop over a distance d, what do you
think is the force model that gives the lowest maximum force during the brake?
Falling onto a trampoline—Spring force model: For a trampoline, the force F is
a spring force F(y) = −ky when y < 0 m. The net force on the person in Phase 2
is therefore
Fnet
y = F − mg = −ky − mg , (10.40)
which is a force that depends only on the position. The work of the net force from
y1 to y2 is therefore:

where we have used that y2 = −d and y1 = 0 m. We insert this result in the work-
energy theorem:
W1,2 = − 1
2 kd2 + mgd = K2 − K1 = −K1 = −mgh = (10.42)
where we used that K2 = 0 and that K1 = mgh from (10.36).
Falling onto a trampoline—Discussion: This result allows us to find k if we know
d and h, or, alternatively, to find d if we know k and h. Here, we know d and h
and are interested in finding k, since this allows us to calculate the force from the
trampoline. From (10.42) we get:
1
2 kd2 = mg (d + h) . (10.43)
The force from the trampoline on the person jumping increases with the deformation
of the trampoline, and is at its maximum when the trampoline is maximally deformed,
which occurs when y = −d. The force is then:
Fmax = kd = 2
d
1
2 kd2 = 2
d mg (d + h) , (10.44)
where we have used the result from (10.43). Again, we assume that reasonable values
are h = 6 m and d = 1m, giving:
Fmax = kd = 2mg (1 + (6 m/(1 m)) = 14mg , (10.45)
which is double the value of the constant force F = 7mg we found for the constant
force above.
Again, the simplicity of the approach is striking. We do not have to calculate the
velocity v1 after the person has fallen a height h, we only need to know the kinetic
energy at this point in order to carry out the rest of the calculation.
The work integrals are illustrated in Fig. 10.6. The blue area corresponds to the net
work during free fall, and the red area corresponds to the net work during braking.
Here, we have essentially selected the spring constant k, which is the slope of the
curve, so that the red area over a length d corresponds to the blue area over the
length h.
Test your understanding: How will d and F change if you double the spring constant k of the
trampoline?

Fig. 10.7 The measured force F(y) as a function of the position y of the top of the cushion. Notice
that y is negative when the cushion is compressed
10.3.2 Example: Stopping in a Cushion
You have installed a new soft cushion from SoftCush technology to prevent falling
damage. According to the producers, the cushion has been developed to produce a
normal force that depends on the compression of the cushion only (and not on the
speed of deformation). You do not know the functional form of the force response,
F(y), of the cushion, but you have measured the response in a controlled experiment
where you pushed the cushion down to a position y and measured the correspond-
ing force F(y). The results are provided in the file cushionforce.d, 3 and shown in
Fig. 10.7.
Problem: If you jump from a height h and onto the cushion, how far will it compress
before you stop? What is the maximum of the force from the cushion on you?
Approach: The cushion reaches its maximum compression when you stop, that is,
when your kinetic energy is zero. We will first use the work-energy theorem to find
the kinetic energy you have after falling a distance h, and then we will use the work-
energy theorem during the contact with the cushion, from you touch the cushion and
until you stop.
Sketch and Identify: Figure 10.8 shows an illustration of the forces acting on the
person during the jump and a free-body diagram of the person.
Model: We divide the motion into two phases, phase 1 from x0 = h to x1 = 0, where
the person is only affected by gravity, G = mg, and phase 2 from x1 = 0 to x2 = −d,
where the person is affected by gravity, G, and the force from the cushion, F.
Phase 1: Free fall: In phase 1 the person starts from rest, v0 = 0 and K0 = 0, at
a height x0 = h, and reaches the height, x1 = 0 with a velocity, v1 , and a kinetic
energy, K1 .

W0,1 =

G dx =

−mg dx = mgh = K1 − K0 = K1 , (10.46)
where we have used that K0 = 0. We see that K1 = (1/2)mv2
1 = mgh, so that we
can determine v1 if needed.
Phase 2: Contact with cushion: In phase 2 the person starts with velocity v1 and
kinetic energy K1 at the height y1 = 0 and stops with velocity v2 = 0 and kinetic
energy K2 = 0 at height y2 = −d. You are in contact with the SoftCusion, and the
net force affecting you is therefore:
Fnet = F(x) − mg , (10.47)
We apply the work-energy theorem from 1 to 2 to determine d, the stopping
distance:
W1,2 =
∫ x2
x1
Fnet dx =
∫ −d
0
(F(x) − mg) dx = K2 − K1 = −mgh , (10.48)
where we have used that K2 = 0 and K1 = mgh from (10.46).
The idea is that the value for d that satisfies (10.48) gives us the maximum com-
pression of the cushion. Unfortunately, (10.48) is not an explicit equation in d that
10.3 Work Done by One-Dimensional Force Models 287
we can solve since the unknown d is the upper limit in the integral. If we knew how
to solve the integral analytically, we might have been able to solve the equation, but
in this case we only know how to solve the integral numerically. How can we solve
such an equation and find the d that satisfies (10.48)?
What we need to do, is to calculate the work:
W1,2 =
∫ x∗
0
F(x)dx − mgx∗ , (10.49)
as a function of the position x∗ of the jumper. Our plan is to vary x∗ until we find a
value for x∗ that satisfies the equation, which corresponds to −d. We need to vary x∗
systematically. We start from x∗ = 0, where the jumper comes in contact with the
cushion, and then gradually decrease x∗ (remember that the jumper is moving down
during the contact with the cushion) until the equation is satisfied, that is, until we
find the value for x∗ for which W1,2 is closest to −mgh. More precisely, we make
a sequence of x∗ values starting from 0, decreasing in small steps, Δx: x∗
0 = 0,
x∗
1 = x∗
0 + Δx, and we calculate the work for each of these numbers until the work
is equal to −mgh.
Can we use any step size Δx in this sequence of x∗
i values? If we knew the force
F(x) for any position x, we could calculate the work at any resolution Δx. But in this
case we only know the forces F(x i ) for the values x i where it has been measured.
Therefore, the best possible resolution we can get is to use the measured x i values
as our sequence of x∗
i -values. This means that we start by calculating the work for
x∗
1 = x1 . Then we calculate the work for x∗
2 = x2 , then for x∗
3 = y3 and so on, until,
for some value i, the work is approximately equal to −mgh.
How do we calculate the work for x∗ = x k , where k is a number in the sequence
of x i values in the datafile? The integral in (10.49) can be calculated using the
trapezoidal rule even if we do not know the underlying function—it works well also
for a measured dataset:
∫ x k

F(x) dx 
k∑
i=1
(x i+1 − x i ) 1
2
[F(x i ) + F(x i+1)] . (10.50)
Numerically, this is done using the function trapz. Here, we only want to do the
sum over the first k values of x i , that is, we only want to do the sum from x1 to
x k in the list of n such x-values. This corresponds to doing the sum over the first
[0:k-1] elements in the position array x:
xval, F = loadtxt(’cushionforce.d’,usecols=[0,1],unpack=True)
k = 10
I = trapz(F[0:k-1],x=xval[0:k-1])
We calculate the work for all possible values of k, and store the results in an array
work, which gives us the work as a function of k:
from pylab import *
m = 80.0 # kg
g = 9.8 # m/sˆ2

h = 6.0 # m
x, F = loadtxt(’cushionforce.d’,usecols=[0,1],unpack=True)
n = length(x)
work = zeros(n,float)
for k in range(1,n-1):
I = trapz(F[0:k],x=-x[0:k])
work[k] = I - m*g*x[k]
plot(y,work,’-b’)
xlabel(’x (m)’)
ylabel(’W(x) (J)’)
Figure 10.9 shows the work W1,2 as a function of the position x calculated using
this program. In the same plot we have also shown the value for −mgh. We see
that the work starts at zero and decreases gradually as the deformation increasesa
and x becomes a large negative number because the work done is negative: The net
work acts to reduce the kinetic energy. When the work reaches the value −mgh
the jumper stops: the kinetic energy is now zero. How can we find the x-value this
occurs at from our numerical data? Based on the plot, we realize that the x value
when W1,2 = −mgh can be found as the first value in the sequence of x i ’s for
which W1,2 < −mgh. This value of x will correspond to a work that is slightly
smaller than −mgh, but this is a good first approximation. How can we find this
value numerically? We use the function find:
i2 = min(find(work<mgh))
x2 = x(i2)
The function find(work<-mgh) returns a list of all the indexes of work that
satisfies the condition work<-mgh. We need to find the first of the indexes in this
sequence, therefore we take the minimum index in this list, and find the corresponding
y-value. We have found the maximum compression of the cushion!
What is the cushion force at this value? This is the corresponding cushion force:
F(y2) = 7050 N found by:
>>F2 = F[i2]
>>print F2
F2 = 7050
What would happen if the jumper started from h = 9 m instead? We plot the cor-
responding value for −mgh in Fig. 10.9. You can read the maximum compression
directly from this graph, or determine it numerically as we did above.

Work of Tangential and Normal Forces
Figure 10.10 illustrates a general three-dimensional motion from 0 to 1. For this
motion, the net work is
W =
∫ t1
t0
Fnet · v dt = K1 − K0 . (10.51)
Because v points in the tangential direction, we notice that it is only the tangential
component of the force that does any work! We can demonstrate this by introducing
a local coordinate system along the path of motion, with unit vectors ˆu T in the
tangential direction and ˆu N in the normal direction. The velocity vector points along
the tangential unit vector:
v = v ˆu T (t) . (10.52)
If we decompose a force, F j , in the tangential and normal directions along the path
of motion:
F j = F j,T (t) ˆu T (t) + F j,N (t) ˆu N (t) , (10.53)
we see that the work done by the force F j is:
W j =
∫ t1
t0
F j · dr
dt dt (10.54)
=
∫ t1
t0
(F j,T (t) ˆu T (t) + F j,N (t) ˆu N (t)) · dr

where we have used that the normal unit vector, ˆu N , is normal to the velocity vector,
v. Consequently, it is only the tangential component of the force that contributes to
the work.
This is also intuitive, since we know that normal forces only contribute to a change
in the direction of the velocity vector and not to a change in the speed—it is only
the tangential force that can cause a tangential acceleration which causes a change
in speed.
Work of a Constant Force in Two and Three Dimensions
The work done by a constant force has a particularly simple solution. Let us address
the work done on an object by a constant force F as the object is moved from r(t0)
to r(t1) as illustrated in Fig. 10.11. The work done on the object is
W F =
∫ t1
t0
F · vdt =
∫ 1

F · dr , (10.58)
Since the force is constant, we move it outside the integration:
W F = F ·

=(r(t1)−r(t0))
= F · (r(t1) − r(t0)) . (10.59)
We call s = Δr = r(t1) − r(t0) the displacement. The work of a constant force is
therefore:
W = F · Δr . (10.60)

10.4 Work Done in Two- and Three-Dimensional Motions 291
Notice that the work done by a constant force depends only on the displacement
Δr and not on the path taken! The work done along the two paths r(t) and r′(t) in
Fig. 10.11 are therefore the same for a constant force. This is a very nice property
of a force, since it makes it convenient to calculate the work done. A force with
this property is called a conservative force, and we will see that such forces play a
prominent role in our studies of mechanical energy.
10.4.1 Example: Work of Gravity
Problem: A projectile is moving through the air starting with an initial velocity v0
at the height y0 . Find the speed of the projectile at the height y1 . You can neglect air
resistance.
Identify: In this problem we address the motion of the projectile, described by the
position r(t). The projectile is at y0 at t0 with a velocity v0 , and at a height h1 at t1
with a speed v1 .
Model: The projectile is only affected by gravity, which is constant, G = −mg j.
Solve: We can therefore use the work-energy theorem to find the kinetic energy of
the projectile:
W =
∫ t1
t0
G · v dt =
∫ 1
0
G · dr = K1 − K0 . (10.61)
Since the force is constant, the work only depends on the displacement:
W = G · s = (−mg j) · (Δx i + Δy j) = −mgΔy . (10.62)
The motion in the x-direction has no impact on the work. It is only the displacement
in the y-direction that contributes to a change in kinetic energy:
K1 − K0 = 1
2 mv2
1 − 1
2 mv2
0 = −mgΔy , (10.63)
The speed v1 is therefore:
v2
1 = v2
0 − 2g (y1 − y0) , (10.64)
The right-hand side must be positive for this equation to have a meaningful solution.
10.4.2 Example: Roller-Coaster Motion
Problem: A roller-coaster cart is rolling from the height h to the height 0 along a
curving roller-coaster track. It starts with the speed v0 at the top of the track. Find
292 10 Work
Fig. 10.12 A roller-coaster
cart moving along a
roller-coaster track
the speed v1 of the roller-coaster cart at the bottom of the track. You can ignore air
resistance and friction.
Identify: The cart follows the path r(t) from r(t0) = h j at t = t0 to r(t1) = 0 j at
t = t1 , as illustrated in Fig. 10.12.
Model: The cart is affected by the normal force, N, the friction force, f, and gravity,
G = −mg j. We assume that friction is negligible, f = 0 throughout the motion. The
normal force N varies throughout the motion. It is therefore not that simple to apply
Newton’s second law directly to determine the motion of the cart. However, because
the normal force always is normal to the path of motion, it performs no work. We
can therefore apply the work-energy theorem to determine the velocity of the cart at
the end of the track.
Solve: The work energy-theorem relates the work of the net force to the change in
kinetic energy:
Wnet = ΔK = K1 − K0 = 1
2 mv2
1 − 1
2 mv2
0 . (10.65)
We can therefore find the speed, v1 , if we know the net work:
Wnet =
∫ t1

Fnet · v dt =
∫ t1

(N + G) · v dt =
∫ t1
t0
N · v︸︷︷︸
=0
dt +
∫ t1

G · v dt = W G
(10.66)
As we argued above, the normal force does no work. The work done by gravity is
the same as we have found previously:
W G =
∫ 1
0
G · dr = G ·
∫ 1
0
dr = G · (r(t1) − r(t0)) . (10.67)
Since G = −mg j, only the vertical component of the displacement is included in
the work:
W G = −mgj · (r(t1) − r(t0)) = −mg(y1 − y0) = −mg(0 − h) = mgh . (10.68)
10.4 Work Done in Two- and Three-Dimensional Motions 293
We use this result in the work-energy theorem to find v1 :

2 mv2
1 − 1
2 mv2
0 = mgh ⇒ v2
1 = v2
0 + 2gh . (10.69)
Analyze: We have learned that for motion with a normal force, the normal force
does no work and we can therefore use the same analysis as for an object falling due
to gravity. However, this is only true as long as there are no additional forces that
depend on the normal force, such as a friction force, or a force that depends on for
example the velocity of the cart, such as the air resistance. In these cases, we need
to make a more detailed analysis.
10.4.3 Example: Work on a Block Sliding Down a Plane
Problem: A classical problem in mechanics is the motion of a block sliding down
an inclined plane. If the block starts from rest, what is the velocity of the block when
it has moved a vertical distance h? The plane forms an angle α with the horizontal,
the mass of the block is m, the acceleration of gravity is g, and μ is the dynamic
coefficient of friction between the block and the plane.
Approach: We use the work-energy theorem to find the change in velocity from the
change in kinetic energy, which only depends on the vertical displacement.
Identify: We use r(t) to describe the motion of the block from r(t0) at t = t0 to r(t1)
at t = t1 , as illustrated in Fig. 10.13.
Model: The block is affected by the normal force from the plane, N, the friction
force, f, and gravity, G = −mg j. Since the block is sliding relative to the surface,
the we use a dynamic friction model:
h
v0 =0
Gf

Fig. 10.13 A block sliding down along an inclined plane
294 10 Work
f = −μ N v
v . (10.70)
where the normal force must be determined from the motion in the direction normal
to the plane. Since we assume that there is no motion normal to the plane, Newton’s
second law gives:
∑ F N = N + G N = ma N = 0 ⇒ N = −G N . (10.71)
where G N is the component of gravity in the normal direction, given by the unit
vector, ˆu N . From Fig. 10.13 we see that:
ˆu N = sin α i + cos α j . (10.72)
We find G N by projecting G on ˆu N :
G N = G · ˆu N = −mg j · (sin α i + cos α j) = −mg cos α , (10.73)
which inserted in (10.71) gives: N = mg cos α.
Solve: The work-energy theorem for the motion of the block relates the work done
by the net force on the block to the change in kinetic energy, Wnet = K1 − K0 , where
Wnet = ∑
j
W j = W N + W f + W G . (10.74)
The work done by the normal force is zero, since it is always normal to the direction
of motion: W N = 0. Since gravity is a constant, the work done by gravity only
depends on the displacement, Δr:
W G = G · Δr = −mg (y0 − y1) = mgh . (10.75)
In this particular case, we can find the work done by friction, because the friction
force is constant during the motion:
W f =
∫ t1
t0
f · v dt = f · Δr . (10.76)
where both f and Δr are directed along the slope. The work done by friction is
therefore
W f = − f s , (10.77)
10.4 Work Done in Two- and Three-Dimensional Motions 295
where s is the distance along the slope. For a slope with an inclination α, the distance
s is related to the height h by:
h
s = sin α ⇒ s = h
sin α . (10.78)
This gives:
W f = − f s = −μ N h
sin α = −μ mg h cos α
sin α . (10.79)
We apply the work-energy theory to find the kinetic energy and the speed at the end
of the slope:
Wnet = W N + W f + W G = mgh − μmgh cot α = K1 − K0 = 1
2 mv2
1 , (10.80)
where we have used that K0 = 0. This gives
v2
1 = 2gh (1 − μ cot α) . (10.81)
10.5 Power
You are pulling a crate along the floor with a force F. In a small time interval Δt
you have pulled the crate from the position r(t) to r(t + Δt), and the force F has
performed the work
ΔW =
∫ t+Δt
t
F · v dt . (10.82)
For a small time interval we can assume that the force F is constant, hence:
ΔW = F ·
∫ t+Δt
t
v dt = F · (r(t + Δt) − r(t)) = F · Δr . (10.83)
We divide by Δt on each side and find that:
ΔW
Δt = F · Δr
Δt (10.84)
and in the limit when Δt → 0 we have the definition of
296 10 Work
Power: Power is the amount of work performed per unit time, that is, the rate
at which we perform work:
P = lim
Δt→0
ΔW
Δt = F · v . (10.85)
The unit of power is Watt (W), which is defined as:
1 W = 1 J/s = 1 Nm/s . (10.86)
We also use the unit of horsepower, hP or hK. The metric horsepower is defined as:
1 hP = 735.5 W . (10.87)
10.5.1 Example: Power Exerted When Climbing the Stairs
Problem: You are climbing the stairs, moving upward at a constant vertical velocity
v0 . What is the power exerted?
Solution: Since you are moving upward with a constant velocity, v0 , your acceleration
upward is zero. Therefore, there is no net force in the vertical direction. The normal
force N exerted from the ground on you therefore equals the gravitational force,
W = mg, if we assume that other forces, such as air resistance, are negligible. The
rate at which the normal force does work on you—the power of the normal force—is:
P = N v0 = mgv0 . (10.88)
10.5.2 Example: Power of Small Bacterium
Problem: A small bacterium with approximately spherical shape is moving with a
constant velocity v through water. Find the power exerted by the bacterium.
Model: The motion of the bacterium is determined by the forces acting on the
bacterium. The bacterium is affected by two main forces: The fluid drag force, D,
and the propulsion force, F, which is a force from the fluid on the bacterium due to
the swirling motion of the bacterium’s tail.
From Newton’s second law we see that:
F + D = ma = 0 , (10.89)
10.5 Power 297
where a = 0 since the bacterium is moving with constant velocity. Consequently,
F = −D . (10.90)
We have a good force model for the fluid drag. Because the bacterium is small and
is moving at a tiny velocity, the fluid drag force is well approximated by the viscous
force model:
D = −k vv . (10.91)
The power exerted by the bacterium corresponds to the power exerted by the force F:
P = F · v = k vv · v = k v v2 . (10.92)
Summary
Work: The work done on an object by the force F moving the object along the path
r(t) is:
W =
∫ t1
t0
F · vdt .
We can write this as a line integral along the path C given by r(t):
W =
∫ 1
0
F · dr .
Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy of an object is defined as:
K = 1
2 mv · v = 1
2 mv2 .
Work-energy theorem: The work done by the net force on an object along the path
from 0 to 1 corresponds to the change in kinetic energy of the object:
Wnet =
∫ t1
t0
Fnet · vdt = K1 − K0
Work of a constant force: The work of a constant force is W = F · s.
Work of a position-dependent force in one dimension: If a force only depends on
the position, Fx = Fx (x), the work is an integral over x only:
W F =
∫ x1
x0
Fx (x)dx .
298 10 Work
It is often easier to solve the work integral for a complicated position-dependent force
than to find the motion of the object. The work-energy theorem is therefore a useful
tool to relate the velocity and position of an object without finding the complete
motion x(t).
Power: The power P exerted by a force F is the rate of work done by the force:
P = F · v

Chapter 11
Energy
You have now learned to use the work-energy theorem as an alternative formulation
of Newton’s second law—as a “calculation” tool to determine the motion of an object.
Using Newton’s second law, we find the motion of an object described as the position
as a function of time. The work-energy theorem allows us to find the velocity as a
function of position without determining the whole motion, and we have learned
that this may be useful, in particular when we are unable to find an exact solution to
the equations of motion. While this was a practical application of the work-energy
theorem, the real strength of the work-energy theorem is a conceptual change: We
go from discussing motion and processes in terms of forces to instead discuss them
in terms of energy and energy conservation.
Conservation laws: One of the most important consequences of Newton’s second
law and its alternative formulation through the work-energy theorem is the concept of
a conservation law: That there are quantities in a system that are conserved throughout
a process. We observe the system and record a particular quantity. Then we let the
system develop in time, and we measure the same quantity again. If the quantity is
conserved, it means that the quantity is unchanged, no matter what happens inside
the system.
The two most important conservation laws you will learn are the conservation
of (mechanical) energy and the conservation of momentum. The conservation laws
in mechanics are consequences of Newton’s laws of motion, but the conservation
law for energy is much more general than that—it is one of the most general laws
we know in nature. Throughout your studies of physics you will gradually learn to
make energy considerations and energy conservation an integral part of your thought
process, starting from this chapter.
In practice the conservation laws represent clever ways to solve physics problems.
In many cases we cannot solve the equations of motion we get from Newton’s second
law directly, but in some cases we can solve the equations we get when we integrate
Newton’s second law. The conservation law for momentum comes from integrating
Newton’s second law in time and the conservation law for energy comes from in-

tegrating along a path, integration along the x-axis in one dimension, as introduced
through the work-energy theorem.
Overview: In this chapter, we introduce the concept of energy and energy conserva-
tion through two examples: A vertical bowshot and an atom moving along a surface.
Based on the examples, we introduce the concept of potential energy for a position-
dependent force, a positional energy, to complement the kinetic energy, an energy of
motion. For objects subject only to position-dependent force, the sum of the potential
and kinetic energy is constant. We can therefore interpret a motion as a transfer of
energy between kinetic and potential energies.
We show how to calculate the potential energy for a constant force, a spring
force, and a general position-dependent force, and how to use energy conservation to
solve mechanics problems. We introduce the energy diagram as an alternative way to
analyze and understand motion. We generalize the concept of potential energy to two-
and three-dimensional motion. Finally, we introduce the general energy principle,
the second law of thermodynamics, and relate external work to changes in the total
energy of a system.
11.1 Motivating Examples
The work-energy theorem provides us with an alternative formulation of Newton’s
second law that is particularly suited to find the velocity as a function of position in
the case when only position-dependent forces act on an object. But we can simplify
the analysis even further by the introduction of a position-dependent energy to com-
plement the velocity-dependent kinetic energy, allowing us to use the conservation
of total energy as an every quicker way to resolve questions relating the velocity and
the position of an object subject only to position-dependent forces. We demonstrate
this method by addressing a vertical bowshot and motion along a surface.
Work-Energy as a Conservation Law
How can the work-energy integral be considered a conservation law? And what do
we mean by conservation? We know that any motion must satisfy Newton’s second
law and its path integral, the work-energy theorem. Let us see how this behaves in
a simplified case—for a one dimensional motion with a net force that only depends
on the position, Fnet = F(x). The work-energy integral is then
W0,1 =
∫ t1
t0
F(x(t))v(t) dt =
∫ x1
x0
F(x) dx = φ(x1)−φ(x0) = K1 − K0 , (11.1)
where we have introduced the function φ(x), which is the indefinite integral of F(x),
so that d F/dx = φ(x). This equation is valid for any two points x0 and x1 along the
11.1 Motivating Examples 305
motion. We can rearrange this equation, so that all the quantities related to position
0 is on the left hand side and all the quantities related to position 1 is on the right
hand side:
K0 − φ(x0) = K1 − φ(x1) . (11.2)
The function, K −φ(x) is a constant along the motion—it is conserved for the motion.
We have found an example of a conservation law! Let us examine this conservation
law in two simple examples to gain more intuition:
Vertical Shot
If you shoot an arrow vertically upwards, and we neglect air resistance, the arrow is
affected by gravity, G = −mg, alone. This is a one-dimensional motion with a net
force that only depends on position. (The force is constant and does therefore not
depend on anything else than the position). If the arrow starts from y = y0 with a
velocity v0 , we can apply the work-energy theorem to find the kinetic energy, K1 , at
any other position, y1 . And from the kinetic energy we can find the velocity, v1 , if so
we please. The work-energy theorem gives:
W0,1 =
∫ t1
t0
Gv y dt =
∫ y1
y0
−mg dy = mgy0 − mgy1 = K1 − K0 , (11.3)
Let us rearrange this equation so that everything that refers to position 0 is on the
left hand side, and everything that relates to position 1 is on the right hand side:
mgy0 + K0 = mgy1 + K1 . (11.4)
What does this mean? The left hand side is a constant that depends on the initial
position, y0 , and the initial velocity, v0 , of the arrow. But the position y1 on the right
hand side can be any position along the motion: This means that the sum mgy + K
is constant throughout the motion. How can we interpret the various terms? We
have already introduced the notion “kinetic energy” for the velocity-dependent term,
K = (1/2)mv2 . The mgy term must therefore also have units of energy, and we can
interpret this as an energy too. However, this energy does not depend on the velocity
of the arrow, but on its position. We call this a positional energy, or more commonly,
it is called a potential energy, U = mgy. We see that U is related to the function φ
we defined in (11.1). We can now write the work-energy theorem for the motion as:
U0 + K0 = U1 + K1 = E , (11.5)
where we use the term total energy for the term E, which is the sum of the potential
and kinetic energies of the arrow.

These new concepts provide insights into the motion of the arrow, as illustrated in
Fig. 11.1. The plots show the position y(t) and the kinetic and potential energies K (t)
and U (t) for the motion. We see that initially, the arrow only has kinetic energy and no
potential energy. This is also illustrated by the bar diagram at the bottom of Fig. 11.1.
As the arrow moves upward, the kinetic energy reduces and the potential energy
increases until the arrow reaches its maximum height, where the kinetic energy is
zero and the potential energy is at its maximum, corresponding to the initial kinetic
energy of the arrow. The kinetic energy cannot be negative, and therefore the arrow
cannot go higher than this. As the arrow falls down again, the kinetic energy increases
as the potential energy is reduced. The whole process is often illustrated by the bar
chart diagram, which indicates that the total energy is conserved. It is only how the
energy is distributed between the kinetic and potential energies that varies throughout
the motion.
Motion Along a Periodic Surface
An atom moving along an atomic surface is subject to a periodic force Fx (x):
F(x) = −F0 sin
( 2π x
b
)
, (11.6)
where b is the interatomic distance in the surface and F0 gives the strength of the
interaction. If this is the only force acting on the atom, we can use the work-energy
theorem to determine the velocity of the atom as a function of position. If the atom
moves from x0 to x1 , the work-energy theorem gives us that:

= −U (x1) + U (x0) + K1 − K0 , (11.9)
where we have gotten wiser and have introduced the function U (x) = U ∗ cos
(2π x/b), and U ∗ = F0b/2π, as the potential energy of the atom. We can reor-
ganize the terms, so that all the x0 terms are on the left-hand side:
U (x0) + K0 = U (x1) + K1 . (11.10)
We notice that the potential energy, U (x), may be both positive and negative.
Hmmm. Is that allowed? Yes. We have not said anything about the signs of the
potential energy. Although, the way we have defined kinetic energy does not allow
this to become negative. Still, you may be uncomfortable with an initial negative
potential energy (although you should get used to this thought by the end of this
chapter). There is a simple solution to this: We can add a constant to both sides in
(11.10)—and we can add a constant to the function U (x) since we only care that
its derivative dU/dx = −F(x) and the derivative of a constant will be zero. This
means that you are free to determine the zero level of the potential energy. Here, we
would like the potential energy to be zero for the initial state, where x = x0 , which
we achieve with the potential energy:
U ′
1 = U1 + U ∗ = U ∗
(
1 − cos 2π x
b
)
. (11.11)
This is nice and positive for all values of x1 and it is zero at x = 0. Good. Let us use
this expression for the potential energy, giving the conservation law:
U ′(x) + K = U ∗
(
1 − cos 2π x
b
)
+ K = const. . (11.12)
This conservation law gives useful insight into the motion illustrated in Fig. 11.2.
The plots show the position x(t) of the atom for a small initial velocity v0 , and
corresponding plots of the kinetic, K (t), and potential, U ′(t), energies. The atom
start with an initial kinetic energy, but no potential energy (we designed the potential
energy this way, remember). As it starts moving in the positive x-direction, the
potential energy increases, and the kinetic energy decreases, and the atom slows
down. Until, at a particular value of x, x = x a , the kinetic energy becomes zero. Since
the kinetic energy cannot become less than zero, the atom cannot progress further in
the positive x-direction. All the initial kinetic energy is now potential energy. The
atom then starts moving in the negative x-direction, increasing its kinetic energy (and
therefore speed) until it reaches x = 0. Then the kinetic energy decreases again until

the atom stops at a position x = x b (because the potential energy, U ′(x) is symmetric
around x = 0, we know that x b = −x a ). Throughout this oscillation back and forth
the total energy is distributed between kinetic and potential energy in such a way that
the total remains a constant.
What happens if we start the atom from the same position, x0 , but with a larger
initial velocity, v0 ? Fig. 11.3 illustrates the motion, x(t), and energies for a large
initial velocity, v0 . Since the initial velocity is larger, the total energy, corresponding
to the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, E = K + U ′, is also larger than
in Fig. 11.2. The total energy is illustrated by the dotted line in Figs. 11.2 and 11.3.
Also in this case, we see that as the atom starts to move in the positive x-direction,
the potential energy increases and the kinetic energy decreases. However, in this
11.1 Motivating Examples 309
case, the kinetic energy never goes to zero. The atom therefore continues to move
indefinitely in the positive x-direction. The velocity is therefore always positive, but
it varies in magnitude according to the potential energy. You may wonder at what
initial velocity v0 the atom starts to be “free”—when does the kinetic energy not
become zero? For now, we leave that for you to figure out, but we will revisit this
situation later in the chapter.
These examples introduces the concepts of potential energy and energy conser-
vation. In the rest of the chapter we will put these concepts in a more formal setting,
and see many examples of the power of their use.
11.2 Potential Energy in One Dimension
Through these examples we have introduced the concept of potential energy, defined
through the work-energy theorem. For a one-dimensional motion where the object
is subject to a single force F(x), which only depends on the position and not on
the velocity or the time, we can introduce a potential energy for the force and a
conservation law for the motion. The work-energy theorem for a motion from x0 to
x1 gives
W0,1 =
∫ t1
t0
F(x(t)) dx
dt dt =
∫ x1
x0
F(x) dx = K1 − K0 , (11.13)
We can now introduce the function U (x), which we call the potential energy, so that
the work integral becomes
W0,1 =
∫ x1
x0
F(x) dx = U (x0) − U (x1) = U0 − U1 . (11.14)
Notice the choice of signs in this equation, introduced this way so that we could
“pair” the energies at 0 and 1:
U0 + K0 = U1 + K1 , (11.15)
In the examples above we found that for gravity:
U (x) = mgx , (11.16)
and for atomic motion along a surface
U (x) = U ∗
(
1 − cos 2π x
b
)
. (11.17)
310 11 Energy
We can find the potential energy at any x by calculating the integral of −F(x)
from some point x∗:
U (x) = U (x∗) +
∫ x
x∗
−F(x) dx . (11.18)
Hmmm. What is the value of U (x∗)? We do not know. Actually, we are free to
choose any value we like for U (x∗), because the change in velocity from x0 to x1
only depends on the difference between the potential energy at U (x0) and U (x1).
This may seem confusing at first—that the potential energy is not given as a particular
number, but rather as a function with an undetermined zero level. But you may have
some experience with this already based on your knowledge of calculus. If you look at
(11.18) you may recognize that this defines the potential enegy U (x) as the indefinite
integral of F(x):
U (x) =
∫
−F(x) + C , (11.19)
that is, the function U (x) is the anti-derivative of F(x). We could put this the other
way, the definition of the potential energy U (x) in (11.18) implies that −F(x) is the
derivative of U (x):
Fx (x) = − dU
dx . (11.20)
We see that whatever constant we add to U (x) does not affect the force we get from
taking the derivative.
Conservation of Energy
These relations define the potential energy U (x) and relate it to the force F(x) on the
object. Notice that these definitions are general, and are valid also in cases where we
cannot find a closed expression for the integral of F(x). We have therefore shown that
(11.20) is general, showing that for an object subject to a single, position-dependent
force, F(x), the total energy is conserved throughout the motion:
E0 = U (x0) + K0 = U (x1) + K1 = E1 . (11.21)
We say that the mechanical energy of the object is conserved.
We call the corresponding force F(x) a conservative force, if the mechanical
energy is conserved. The mechanical energy is conserved if there exists a potential
U (x) for the force F(x), or, to formulate it in an alternative way: If the work done
by the force only depends on the end-points of the motion. Both statements may be
used as equivalent definitions of a conservative force:
11.2 Potential Energy in One Dimension 311
The work done by a conservative force only depends on the end-points of the
motion and not on the path taken.
A force F(x) is conservative if and only if it can be written as the derivative
of the potential U (x):
Fx (x) = − dU
dx . (11.22)
We call U (x) the potential for F(x) or the potential energy of the object.
In one dimension, a force F(x) that only depends on the position x (and not on
the velocity or time) is conservative, since we can always find a potential U (x), as
demonstrated above. But in two- and three-dimension, a force that depends only on
the position is generally not conservative. A conservative force needs to fulfil an
additional condition that we return to later.
Potential Energy for a Constant Force
An object moves from x A to x B while subject to a constant net force, F0 , in the
x-direction. What is the potential energy for the object?
We find the potential energy from the integral in (11.18), starting from x = x0 :
U (x) = U (x0) +
∫ x
x0
−F0 dx = U (x0) − F0 (x − x0) , (11.23)
where we are free to choose the value for U (x0). For example, we may choose
U (x0) = −F0 x0 , which gives:
U (x) = −F0 x . (11.24)
We recognize this from our previous calculation of the potential energy for the vertical
bowshot, where the arrow is only subject to a (constant) gravity, G = F0 = −mg,
and therefore:
U (x) = −F0 x = − (−mg) x = mgx . (11.25)
Energy conservation for an object subject to a constant force can therefore be ex-
pressed as:
312 11 Energy
E0 = U0 + K0 = U1 + K1 = E1 (11.26)
E0 = −F0 x0 + 1
2 mv2
0 = −F0 x1 + 1
2 mv2
1 = E1 , (11.27)
and for motion in the gravity field, we recover the well-know result:
mgx0 + 1
2 mv2
0 = mgx1 + 1
2 mv2
1 . (11.28)
Potential Energy in the Gravity Field with Normal Forces
The conservation of mechanical energy for motion subject only to gravitational forces
is a useful tool to find simple solutions and make quick judgements about motions.
However, the method is even more versatile. We can also use it when an object is
subject to gravity and a normal force, because the normal force does no work on the
object during the motion.
Let us demonstrate the use of potential energy methods for motion under gravity
and normal forces by studying the motion of a bead moving along a friction-free
wire shaped as a helix, as illustrated in Fig. 11.4. The forces acting on the bead are
gravity, G = −mg j, and a normal force, N, from the wire on the bead.
We apply the net work-energy theorem for motion from position 0 at a height y0 ,
to a point P at a height y. The work done on the bead by the net force Fnet = G + N
is then:

where we place all the terms for state 0 on the left side and for state 1 on the right
side, getting:

mgy0 + K0 = mgy + K , (11.30)
which shows that mechanical energy is conserved for motion under gravity with a
normal force, which is what we expected since the normal force does no work during
the motion. The shape of the path does not matter: The energies depend only on the
vertical position of the bead.
Potential Energy for a Spring Force
We have already discussed the potential for a constant force. The next step is to
study the simlest possible (one dimensional) force that depends on position alone:
the spring force. What is the potential energy of an object subject to a spring force
F(x)?
Figure 11.5 illustrates a spring block system, where a block of mass m lies on a
frictionless table. The block is attached to a spring with spring constant k, and the
equilibrium position of the block-spring system is b. The force F on the block from
the spring is modelled using a spring force model: F(x) = −k(x − b), where x is
the position of the block.
The force F depends on the position of the block only: It does not depend on the
velocity of the block, and it does not depend directly on time. We can therefore find
the potential energy by integrating the force F(x) using the definition in (11.18):
U (x) − U (x0) =
∫ x1
x0
−F(x) dx =
∫ x1
x0
k(x − b) dx = 1
2 kx2

2 kx2
0 . (11.31)
We are free to choose U (x0), so we may choose U (x0) so that U (x) is zero when
the spring is in its equilibrium position. That is, we want U (b) = 0:
U (b) = U (x0) + 1
2 kb2 − 1
2 kx2
0 = 0 ⇒ U (x0) = 1
2 kx2
0 . (11.32)
The potential energy for a spring force F(x) = −k(x − b) is therefore:
U (x) = 1
2 k(x − b)2 . (11.33)

Potential Energy of Many Individual Forces
In generatl, objects are affected by several forces simultaneously. For example, a
person jumping on a trampoline is affected both by gravity and by the contact force
from the trampoline. How can we extend our energy conservation approach to such
cases?
The net force on an object affected by several forces F j , where j = 1, 2, . . . , is
Fnet = ∑
j
F j (x) . (11.34)
Let us assume that each of the forces F j (x) are conservative, that is, they depend
on the position x only (and not on velocity or time). The potential energy for force
F j (x) is U j (x). The work-energy theorem for a motion from x0 to x1 gives:
W net

(U j (x0) − U j (x1)) = K1 − K0 . (11.35)
We move all the terms relating to position 0 to the right-hand side of the equation:
∑

︸ ︷︷ ︸
U (x1)
+K1 = ∑
j
U j (x0)
︸ ︷︷ ︸

where the potential energy U (x) is the sum of the potential energies for each of the
forces F j (x). This gives a general law for energy conservation:
U (x1) + K1 = U (x0) + K0 . (11.37)
We can therefore generalize the energy conservation methods introduced above by
introducing a potential energy for each of the forces affecting the object. Energy
conservation still holds, as long as we include the sum of all the potential energies
for all the forces affecting the object.
11.2.1 Example: Falling Faster
Problem: You throw an apple directly downward from a high cliff, giving it an initial
velocity v0 . How far does the apple need to fall before it doubles its velocity? You
can neglect the effects of air resistance.
11.2 Potential Energy in One Dimension 315
Identify: The position of the apple is given by y(t). At t0 , the apple is at y = y0
with velocity v = −v0 . At t1 , the apple is at y = y1 with velocity v1 = −2v0 .
Model: The only force acting on the apple is gravity. We know that for motion under
gravity, the total mechanical energy of the object is conserved throughout the motion:
E = U + K = constant (11.38)
We use this to find the relation between the position and velocity of the apple.
Solve: The mechanical energy of the apple when at y0 is:
E0 = U0 + K0 = mgy0 + 1
2 mv2
0 , (11.39)
and at y1 it is:
E1 = U1 + K1 = mgy1 + 1

Since energy is conserved, we know that:
E0 = E1

We want to find y1 when we know that v1 = −2v0 . We insert v1 = −2v0 , and find:
mgy0 + 1

Problem: Let us revisit the roller-coaster problem using an energy conservation
approach: A roller-coaster cart is rolling from the height h to the height 0 along a
curving roller-coaster track. It starts with the speed v0 at the top of the track. Find
the speed of the roller-coaster cart at the bottom of the track. You can ignore air
resistance and friction.
Identify: The cart moves from the position 0, x(t0) = x0 , y(t0) = y0 , to position 1,
x(t1) = x1 , y(t1) = y1 as illustrated in Fig. 11.6.

Model: The cart is affected by the normal force, N, the friction force, f, and gravity,

Solve: Since the normal force, N, does no work on the cart during the motion, we
can use the conservation of energy to determine the relation between position and
velocity of the cart. The conservation of mechanical energy of the cart gives:
E = K0 + U0 = K1 + U1 , (11.44)
where we use that U (y) = mgy:
1

Analyze: This is, of course, exactly the same result as we found above when we
used the net work-energy theorem. However, the use of energy considerations is
much simpler and allows us to use more of our intuition about the process than the
application of the net work-energy theorem.
11.2.3 Example: Pendulum
Problem: A classical problem is that of the motion of a pendulum. A pendulum
consists of sphere of mass m hanging in a massless rope of the length L. The pendulum
moves in a vertical plane with a maximum angle θ0 with the vertical. Find the velocity
v of the sphere as a function of the angle θ. We neglect air resistance.
Identify: We describe the motion of the pendulum with the angle θ between the rope
and the vertical. We assume that the sphere follows a circular path. The system is
illustrated in Fig. 11.7.

Model: The sphere is affected by the tension, T, from the rope and gravity, G. We
already know that for motion under gravity we can use energy considerations to relate
position and velocity. What about the tension T? It is always normal to the direction
of motion of the sphere. The rope tension T is a normal force, which does no work
during the motion. We can therefore use energy conservation to solve the problem.
We examine two positions, as illustrated in Fig. 11.8, and use energy conservation
to relate the two positions. In position 0 the sphere is at the top of its path. This is
where the motion changes direction. The velocity is zero at this position. In position
1 the sphere is at an angle θ and the velocity of the sphere is v.
Energy conservation gives:
E = U0 + K0 = U + K , (11.47)
E = mgy0 + K0 = mgy + K , (11.48)
In order to find the velocities as a function of θ, we need to relate the vertical positions
y0 and y to the angle θ. From Fig. 11.8 we see that the vertical position of the sphere is
y0 = −L cos θ0 and y = −L cos θ , (11.49)
where we have chosen the origin of the coordinate system to at the attachment point
of the pendulum. We insert this into (11.48):

and we solve to find the velocity v:
v2 = 2gL (cos θ − cos θ0) ⇒ v = √2gL (cos θ − cos θ0) , (11.51)
where we have used that v0 = 0.
Analyze: For this problem, energy considerations are particularly powerful, since
it is difficult, if not impossible, to find an analytical solution to the motion of the
pendulum. But using energy conservation we find the exact, analytical solution to
the posed question, without solving for the path θ(t).
11.2.4 Example: Spring Cannon
This problem is a classic in mechanics
Problem: A block of mass m is placed on top of a vertical, massless spring with
spring constant k. The spring is contracted a distance Δy from its equilibrium position
(when there is no block on top of it). The spring is released, and the block is shot
up through the air. How high up does the block go? You may neglect friction and air
resistance.
Identify: The motion of the block is one dimensional, and we characterize the po-
sition of the block by its vertical position y. The block starts at a vertical position
y0 at the time t0 with no vertical velocity v0 = 0. The block is in contact with the
spring until the time t1 when the vertical position is y1 . From there on, the block is
moving through the air without being in contact with the spring. The block reaches
its maximum height y2 at the time t2 , and the velocity of the block at this point is
v2 = 0. The process is illustrated in Fig. 11.9.
Model: The block is affected by two forces: The spring force F and the force from
gravity, G = −mg j. Both gravity and the spring force are conservative forces. We
can therefore apply energy conservation to relate the position and velocity of the
block. However, the spring force is only acting when y < y1 .
Solve: We use conservation of mechanical energy to solve this problem. Energy
is conserved because all forces only depend on the position of the block. They do
not depend on the velocity of the block or directly on time. Mechanical energy is
therefore conserved throughout the motion. In particular, it is the same at the points
0, 1, and 2.
E0 = U0 + K0 = U1 + K1 = E1 = U2 + K2 = E2 . (11.52)
Here, we realize that the total potential energy U consists of the potential energy
from the spring force, U F and the potential energy from gravity, U G :
U (y) = U G (y) + U F (y) . (11.53)

where we are free to chose where the potential energy is zero. That is, we are free to

Also, we know that the potential energy of the interaction between the spring and
the block is
U F (y) = 1
2 k(y − y1)2 , (11.55)
where we have chosen the potential energy of the spring-block interaction to be zero
when the spring is at its equilibrium position, that is, for y = y1 . We find the energies
at the three positions 0, 1, and 2:

. (11.58)
In position y2 , the block is not in contact with the spring. The force from the spring
on the block is therefore zero from y1 to y2 . The potential energy of the spring-block
interaction is thererfore the same for y1 and for y2 , that is, the potential energy of
the spring-block interaction is also zero at y2 .
Notice that even though we include the position y1 in this calculation, we do
not need this in order to determine y2 . Because energy is conserved throughout the
320 11 Energy
whole motion, we only need to relate position 0 to position 2: E0 = E2 . This is a
particularly nice feature of using energy considerations when solving a problem!
We can now solve to find the height y2 :

Analyze: This example illustrates the power and ease of using energy considera-
tions for such a problem. If we instead opted to use Newton’s laws of motion, the
calculations would be significantly longer. But remember that we can only use en-
ergy considerations when all the forces are conservative: If there was friction, air
resistance, or other velocity-dependent force, we could not have used energy consid-
erations directly, and in most cases, we would need to determine the motion in order
to determine the work done by the velocity-dependent forces, and we would need to
solve for the motion anyway.
Comment: Notice how we chose the potential energy for the spring-block interac-
tion. We do not need to choose the potetial energy U F (y) to be zero at y1 , we could
for example also have chosen it to be:
U F (y) = 1
2 k(y − y1)2 + C (11.60)
where C is a constant. However, in this case, we need to ensure that we include this
constant both in the energy at position y1 and at the position y2 . Why also at position
y2 —there is no spring force acting here? It is correct that we are free to choose the
constant C, but we are not free to change this choice between the various phases. If
we have chosen a particular C, we must ensure that our choise is consistent when
we go from y1 to y2 .
11.3 Energy Diagrams
If you launch a small cart in a hilly terrain, as illustrated in Fig. 11.10, how is the
subsequent motion of the cart? For simplicity, we assume that we can neglect the air
drag and friction. What is the velocity as a function of position, and how far will the
cart travel?
We can visualize the motion directly on the figure. Several points have been
highlighted in Fig. 11.10. The cart starts at the point 0. The cart rolls downhill,
increasing its velocity. It reaches the bottom of the hill at 1, and starts rolling uphill.
Will it make it up the hill?
Energy conservation: We can answer such questions using energy conservation.
Because the only forces acting on the cart are gravity and the normal force, and the
11.3 Energy Diagrams 321

frictionless surface. Bottom

normal force does not do any work, the mechanical energy of the cart is conserved
throughout the motion. This means that the sum of the potential and the kinetic
energy is constant:
E = U + K = U (x) + K (x) , (11.61)
where the potential energy for the cart is the potential energy in a (constant) gravity
field:
U (x) = mgy(x) . (11.62)
The vertical position, y(x), is simply the vertical position of the cart as a function of
the horizontal position x. This corresponds to the vertical position of the hill at that
horizontal position. 1
Potential energy landscape: We can therefore construct a plot of the potential energy
of the cart as a function of the horizontal position x. What will this drawing look like?
We know that the potential energy is U (x) = mgy(x). The potential energy therefore
looks exactly like the landscape, as illustrated in the bottom plot in Fig. 11.10.
The cart starts in point 0 at the position x0, y0 on the terrain. The same point is
illustrated in the plot of the potential energy. At this point, the cart has no kinetic
energy since it starts with zero velocity. At the point 0, the total internal energy is:
E = U0 + K0 = U0 , (11.63)
but since the total energy is conserved throughout the motion, the sum of the kinetic
and potential energy is constant and equal to this value everywhere. We illustrate the

surface.
322 11 Energy
total energy by drawing a horizontal line in the potential energy plot. From the figure
we can now read off both the total energy, this is the horizontal line, and the potential
energy as a function of position—this is the curve that looks like the terrain.
Interpreting kinetic energy: How can we use this figure to understand the motion?
At the point 1, the potential energy is smaller than the total energy:
E1 = U1 + K1 = E0 , (11.64)
This means that the amount of energy above the potential energy curve is the kinetic
energy, illustrated by the blue line in the figure. We can therefore read both the
potential energy and the kinetic energy directly from the figure: The kinetic energy
is the distance from the potential energy curve up to the horizontal line that gives
the total energy. We call this diagram an energy diagram. The energy diagram is a
useful tool for discussing the motion of an object.
Limits of possible motion: The kinetic energy is zero where the horizontal line
intersects the potential energy curve (for E = E0 at points x0 , x2 , and x3 .) The
cart cannot cross this line. At this point the speed is zero, and the cart changes
direction. We can therefore use the energy diagram to determine the limits of the
possible motion. The cart cannot have negative kinetic energy—for a given total
energy, this limits the possible positions of the cart. Consequently, when the total
energy is E = E0 , the cart cannot reach the regions indicanted by the dashed line.
Notice that for a given total energy, the cart can be locked into separate domains.
If the cart starts at position 0 with zero kinetic energy, it will never reach point 3.
Similarly, if the cart starts at point 3 with zero kinetic energy, it cannot reach point 0.
However, if we increase the total energy, for example by increasing the speed of
the cart, to the value E∗ on the figure, the cart can move all over the terrain.
Equilibrium points: How do we interpret a flat part of the terrain? A flat part of the
terrain corresponds to a flat part of the potential energy curve. At a flat part, there are
no horizontal forces. A flat part is therefore an equilibrium point. If the cart starts at
rest at an equilibrium point, it will not start moving, because there are no horizontal
forces.
Stable and unstable equilibrium points: The top of a hill and the bottom of a
valley are also flat points. There are no horizontal forces acting on the cart at these
points. But there is a difference between the hilltop and the valleybottom. If you start
from the hilltop (e.g. at x4 ), and give the cart a tiny push, it accelerates away from
the hilltop. We therefore call such a point an unstable equilibrium point. However,
if you start at the bottom of a valley (e.g. at x5 ), and give the cart a tiny push, the
cart accelerates back towards the equilibrium point—we therefore call such a point
a stable equilibrium point.
Limitation of this analogy: While the terrain analogy is visually striking, it has
its limitations. In particular, it obscures the relation between the horizontal force
and the potential energy curve, since the normal force from the ground on the cart
11.3 Energy Diagrams 323
also contributes to the horizontal force. We will therefore continue our discussion
of energy diagrams with other examples, where we can use further properties of the
potential energy curve in our interpretation of the motion.
Energy Diagram of a Spring Force
We can use an energy diagram to address the motion of a block in a spring. A block
of mass m is attached to a spring with spring constant k and equilibrium position b.
The block is lying on a horizontal, frictionless table, as illustrated in Fig. 11.11a.
Model: The only horizontal force on the block is the spring force:
F(x) = −k(x − b) , (11.65)
where x is the position of the block. The net horizontal force on the block is F(x),
which only depends on the position x of the block. It does not depend on the velocity
of the block. The total mechanical energy of the spring-block system is therefore
conserved throughout the motion:
E = U (x) + K = constant . (11.66)
We found in (11.33) that the potential energy U (x) of the spring is:
U (x) = 1
2 k(x − b)2 , (11.67)
and this potential energy is illustrated in the energy diagram in Fig. 11.11b.

diagram for the block
324 11 Energy
Finding motion from the energy diagram: Let us use the energy diagram to de-
termine the motion in a few situations. First, we pull the block from the equilibrium
position x = b to a position x0 > b, and let it go. That is, the block starts at the
position x = x0 with zero initial velocity. How do we illustrate this in the energy
diagram? When we release the block at the position x0 , the block only has potential
energy. That is, at x = x0 , the total energy is:
E0 = U0 + K0 = 1
2 k(x0 − b)2 . (11.68)
The total energy is given by the intersection between the potential energy curve and
the point x = x0 . We draw the total energy as a horizontal line through this point as
illustrated in Fig. 11.11b.
How does the block move? We know that we can read off the kinetic energy as
the distance from the line E = E0 down to the potential energy:
K (x) = E0 − U (x) . (11.69)
In addition, we know that the spring force on the spring also can be found from the
potential energy curve, because we recall that:
F(x) = − dU
dx . (11.70)
When the motion starts, we know that dU/dx > 0, which means that the force acts
in the negative direction, which we of course can verify from the force law in (11.65),
F(x) = −k (x − b), which is negative when x = x0 > b. We see from the energy
diagram that as the block accelerates towards smaller values of x, the slope of the
potential energy curve decreases, and therefore the spring force also decreases, until
the block reaches the point x = b, where dU/dx = 0. Motion continues with x < b,
but now the force is positive, slowing the block down, until it reaches the point x1 ,
where the kinetic energy is zero. We see that the force at this point is positive, since
the slope of U (x) is negative, hence the net force acts in the positive direction: The
spring block is accelerated back towards larger x-values. From this point we realize
that the motion repeats itself indefinitely. The block is oscillating back and forth
between x1 and x0 .
The point x = b is a minimum of the potential energy. At this point, the net force
is zero, because:
F(b) = − dU
dx = 0 , (11.71)
We call all extremal points, where dU/dx = 0, equilibrium points because if the
block starts from this point, there is no force acting on it. It will therefore stay at this
point, in equilibrium.
11.3 Energy Diagrams 325
Equilibrium Points
The simple spring-block system has only one local minimum in the potential energy
and no local maximum. We need a more complex system to discuss the general
behavior of a system near an equilibrium point. This is found in the motion of an
ion trapped between two charged atoms, as illustrated in Fig. 11.12. In this case, the
energy diagram contains two local minima and a local maximum.
Extremal points of the potential energy: What characterizes a local extremum of
the potential energy function? It is where the potential energy is horizontal, that is,
where the slope of the potential energy is horizontal. This occurs when:
dU
dx = 0 , (11.72)
For an energy diagram, we also know that:
F(x) = − dU
dx . (11.73)
The force acting on the system is therefore zero at the extrema of the potential energy
function. This is why we call these points equilibrium points. The equilibrium points
in Fig. 11.12 occur at x1 , x2 , and x3 .
Local minima: What characterizes the behavior around the local minimum at x2 ?
If we place the particle exactly at this point with zero velocity, the force acting on
the particle is zero, and the particle will not move. What happens if the atom did not
start exactly at x2 , but very close, x = x2 + dx.

326 11 Energy
From the energy diagram, we see that the energy at x must be slightly higher than
the energy at x2 , because x2 is a local minimum. Figure 11.12 shows that if the atom
starts at x = x2 + dx, with an energy E2 , the particle will start moving around x2 ,
but it will not stray far from the equilibrium point. This is also evident directly from
the properties of U (x). You may recall from your experience with calculus, that a
local minimum in U (x) is characterized by
dU
dx = 0 and d2U
dx2 > 0 . (11.74)
The first derivative is zero and the second derivative is positive. What is the physical
interpretation of a positive second derivative? Since the force is related to the first
derivative, this means that: d F
dx < 0 ; , (11.75)
at this point. Therefore, if the particle is given a small positive velocity, it starts moving
in the positive direction. But since d F/dx < 0, the force on the particle therefore
becomes negative (since it starts from zero at the equilibrium point). Consequently,
the force acting on the particle tends to return the particle back toward the equilibrium
point. You can make a similar argument when the velocity is negative.
Because the particle will be localized close to the equilibrium point when a small
perturbation is applied, we call this equilibrium point a stable equilibrium point.
Local maxima: What about the local maximum in x = x3 ? Also in this case, the
force acting on the particle when at this point is zero. This is therefore also an
equilibrium point. But what happens if we give the particle a small perturbation, a
small increment ΔK to E3 in the total energy? We see from Fig. 11.12 that in this
case the particle will not stay close to the equilibrium point. For any perturbation,
the particle will move far away from the equilibrium point—this point is called an
unstable equilibrium point.
This argument can also in this case be made from a discussion of the behavior of
the force F(x) = −dU/dx. From calculus, you know that for a local maximum, the
second derivative of U (x) is negative:
dU
dx = 0 and d2U
dx2 < 0 . (11.76)
The derivative of the force is therefore positive:
d F
dx < 0 , (11.77)
at the unstable equilibrium point. What does this result in? If we give the particle a
small positive velocity starting from the equilibrium point, the particle will move in
the positive x-direction, and the force acting on the particle will increase—starting
11.3 Energy Diagrams 327
from zero at the equilibrium point. The force will be positive, giving the particle a
positive acceleration which will bring the particle even further from the equilibrium
point.
11.3.1 Example: Energy Diagram for the Vertical Bow-Shot
Problem: Let us revisit the vertical bow-shot using energy diagrams: Sketch the
energy diagram for a vertical bow-shot, find equilibrium points for the arrow, and
discuss the motion of the arrow for various total energies.
Potential energy of the arrow: We have previously (see Sect. 11.1) found that the
potential energy for an arrow affected by only gravity is:
U (y) = mgy , (11.78)
where y is the vertical position of the arrow. The total mechanical energy of the arrow
is conserved throughout the motion:
U (y) + K (y) = E0 = const , (11.79)
Energy diagram for the arrow: The plot of U (x) in Fig. 11.13 constitutes an energy
diagram. The total energy is conserved and corresponds to a horizontal line, a line
of constant energy, in the energy diagram. The potential energy varies with position,
U (y) = mgy. The kinetic energy can therefore be read from the diagram as the
distance (in energy) from the potential energy and up to the total energy.

Initial conditions: The total energy is determined by the initial conditions. For
example, we could start the motion from y = 0 m with an initial velocity v0 . The
total energy would then be given by
E0 = 1
2 mv2
0 + mgy0 = 1
2 mv2
0 . (11.80)
Each horizontal line, E0 , illustrated in Fig. 11.13 corresponds to a different set of
initial conditions for the arrow: Each line corresponds to a different motion.
Equilibrium points: What can we say about the motion of the arrow for a given
total energy? First, we see if the energy diagram has any equilibrium points—points
where the derivative of the potential is zero. There are no such points: The derivative
of the potential is a constant which is not zero. Second, we analyze the motion for
a given E0 . Notice that we can only discuss general features of the motion based
on the energy diagram alone. From this analysis we do not know at what time the
arrow is at a particular position, but we may relate the position and the velocity of
the arrow.
Turning points: Since the kinetic energy of the arrow cannot be negative, the arrow
cannot propagate into the region where the potential energy is larger than the total
energy. At the point where the potential energy is equal to the total energy, the kinetic
energy is zero, which means that the velocity is zero. This is the turning point of the
arrow: The arrow reverses direction and start moving downwards. The position with
zero velocity is therefore the maximum height of the arrow.
Numerical solution and animations: Notice that we can tell several stories based
on the energy diagram. But for a given set of initial conditions, there is still only
one resulting motion. To illustrate the relation between the motion and the energy
diagram, we have illustrated the motion y(t) for an arrow fired from y = 0 m with
various initial velocities v0 , corresponding to the energies shown in the energy dia-
gram. The motions and the corresponding energy diagrams are shown in Fig. 11.13.
To further illustrate the relation between the motion and the energy diagram, we can
generate an animated plot that shows the position of the arrow as a function of time,
and the time development of position of the arrow in the energy diagram as a function
of time for a given motion. This is implemented by the following program:
from pylab import *
m = 1.0 # kg
g = 9.8 # m/sˆ2
v0 = 10.0 # m/s
y0 = 0.0 # m
time = 2.0*v0/g
ntime = 1000
t = linspace(0.0,time,ntime)
y = y0 + v0*t - 0.5*g*t**2
v = v0 - g*t
U = m*g*y
K = 0.5*m*v**2
E = U + K
for i in range(ntime):

which is illustrated by the animation 2 for y0 = 0 m and a given v0 = 10 m/s.
Test your understanding: Using this program, you can explore the effect of changing the initial
conditions. What happens if you double the initial velocity to v0 = 20 m/s? What happens if you
instead start the arrow from the height y0 = 10 m/s, but with zero velocity?
11.3.2 Example: Atomic Motion Along a Surface
Problem: Let us also revisit the motion of an atom along a surface using energy
diagrams: An atom is moving along the x-axis under influence by a surface force.
The interaction between the atom and the surface is described by the potential energy
of the atom:
U (x) = U ∗
(
1 − cos 2π x
b
)
. (11.81)
Sketch the energy diagram for the atom, find and characterize equilibrium points,
and discuss the motion of the atom for various energies.
Energy diagram: The potential energy is shown in Fig. 11.14. The potential energy
is a periodic function with period b, which we would interpret as a lattice distance
in the atomic arrangement of the surface.
Equilibrium points: Equilibrium points corresponds to positions where the force
on the atom is zero:
F(x) = − dU
dx = 0 , (11.82)
which also are local extrema of the potential energy function. Inserting the potential
energy, we find:
F(x) = − d
dx U ∗
(
1 − cos 2π x
b
)
= U ∗ 2π
b sin 2π x
b = 0 , (11.83)
which occurs when 2π x/b = πn, where odd numbers n correspond to local maxima
and even numbers n, including zero, corresponds to local minima. The local maxima
are unstable equilibrium points and the local minima are stable equilibrium points.
Motion and turning points: If the potential energy from the surface represents the
only force on the atom, the total mechanical energy of the atom is conserved. The
total mechanical energy is illustrated by a horizontal line in the energy diagram in

Fig. 11.14. Two different regimes are evident. If the total energy is smaller than 2U ∗,
the total energy becomes smaller than the potential energy for some values of x.
Since the total energy is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies:
E = U (x) + K (x) , (11.84)
and the kinetic energy cannot be negative, the atom cannot move into regions where
the potential energy is larger than the total energy. These regions therefore become
unaccessible to the atom. For example, if the atom starts near x = 0 and the total
energy is less than 2U ∗, the atom cannot reach x = b. What happens instead? If the
atom starts at x = 0 with an initial velocity v0 , the velocity gradually decreases as
the atom moves to the right, until the velocity becomes zero at x = x1 , and the atom
reverses direction. The atom the accelerates until it reaches x = 0, where the atom
again starts to slow down, until it reaches zero velocity at x = x1 . We can find the
position where the velocity of the atom is zero from the total mechanical energy, if
the atom starts at x = 0 with velocity v0 , the total mechanical energy is:
E0 = U (0) + K0 = 0 + 1

where U (0) = 0. The atom reaches its maximum position when the velocity is zero,

)
. (11.88)
We notice that if K0/U ∗ becomes larger than 2 there is no solution for x1 . This
means that the atom is free to move along the surface. Although the velocity of the
atom still varies as the atom moves along the surface, the velocity now never reaches
zero. This also means that the atom does not turn: If it starts moving in the positive
direction it will continue to move in the positive direction indefinitely.
Numerical solution and animation: We can relate the motion of the atom to the
energy diagram by finding the motion of the atom for various initial positions and
velocities. Since the only force acting on the atom comes from the interaction with
the surface, Newton’s second law gives:
ma = F(x) = − dU
dx , (11.89)
inserting F(x) from (11.83), we find:
a = d2 x
dt2 = − 2πU ∗
mb sin 2π x
b = 0 . (11.90)
We solve this equation using Euler-Cromer’s method, through the following program
that generates an animated plot of the motion as x(t) and as U (x(t)) in the energy

11.4 The Energy Principle
So far we have addressed processes where the work is done by conservative forces
only. Let us now use what we have learned about potential energy to also discuss
processes with non-conservative forces. Non-conservative forces are typically forces
that not only depend on position, but for example also on velocity, such as air resis-
tance or friction. Let us examine the motion of an object subject to both conservative
and non-conservative forces.
We decompose the net force acting on an object into conservative forces, F j , and
a non-conservative force, f:
Fnet = ∑
j
F j + f , (11.91)
If the object moves from r(t0) = r0 at t0 to r(t1) = r1 at t1 , the net work is:
W net
0,1 =
∫ t1
t0
Fnet · v dt =
∫ t1

⎦ · v dt = ∑

∫ t1
t0
f · v dt
= ∑
j
[U (r0) − U (r1)] + W f
0,1 = U0 − U1 + W f
0,1 . (11.92)
The work-energy theorem relates the net work to the change in kinetic energy for
the object:
W net
0,1 = U0 − U1 + W f
0,1 = K1 − K0 . (11.93)
We group terms related to position 1 on the left hand side:
U1 + K1 = U0 + K0 + W f
0,1 . (11.94)
If we introduce the term E1 = U1 + K1 for the total (mechanical) energy of the
object, we get:
E1 = E0 + W f
0,1 , (11.95)
or
E1 − E0 = ΔE = W f
0,1 . (11.96)
The change in the (mechanical) energy of the object is equal to the work done by
the non-conservative force. This law is a completely general law of nature usually
called the second law of thermodynamics or the energy principle:
11.4 The Energy Principle 333
Energy principle:
ΔE = W . (11.97)
The change in (mechanical) energy is equal to the work done by non-
conservative forces (W ).
We will later see how we can relate this energy principle for a single object to a more
general principle for a system of several objects interacting with its environment
through work and heat (thermal energy transfer).
11.4.1 Example: Lift and Release
Problem: If you lift a book from the floor to a height h using a constant force F, and
release it, you have increased the total energy of the book, but the book was affected
by a constant force. How can we explain this using the energy principle?
Solution: When you are not holding the book, and the book is falling, it is affected by
the gravitational force alone. The total mechanical energy of the book (when falling)
is therefore:
E = U + K = mgy + 1
2 mv2 . (11.98)
Initally, the book was lying on the floor with zero velocity. In this case, the total
mechanical energy is:
E0 = mgy0 + 1
2 mv2
0 = 0 J . (11.99)
If we choose the potential energy to be zero when the book lies on the floor, that is,
when y = 0 m and v0 = 0 m/s. When the book is at rest (v1 = 0 m/s) at y1 = h, the
total mechanical energy is:
E1 = mgh + 1
2 mv2
1 = mgh . (11.100)
The change in mechanical energy is therefore:
ΔE = E1 − E0 = mgh . (11.101)
where did this energy come from? It came from the work done by the constant force
F lifting the book to the height h.
W F
0,1 = F(y1 − y0) = Fh . (11.102)
334 11 Energy
Because F is a non-conservative force, the energy principle gives that:
ΔE = W F
0,1 = Fh = mgh . (11.103)
The work done by F corresponds to the work done by a constant force mg. But, you
protest, the force F is a conservative force, since it is a constant. Something must be
wrong with the energy principle!
Not so fast. The force F was constant only when you lifted the book. Afterwards,
you released the book, and this applied force therefore became zero. The force F
is therefore not that constant after all. This is indeed how we should regard such a
force: The force F lifting the book is a time-dependent force. It only acted when the
book was lifted. It does not act when the book is released afterwards. Then it is only
affected by gravity. This is why we call it a non-conservative force. We could look
at it in a different way: The force F does not only depend on the position y of the
book, because when we lift the book, it is affected by the lifting force, but afterwards,
when the book is released, it may be falling through the same position without being
affected by the lifting force. Thus the lifting force is not a conservative force, and
we must use the energy principle to understand the change in mechanical energy as
caused by the work done by non-conservative forces.
11.4.2 Example: Sliding Block
Problem: A block is sliding down an inclined plane forming an angle α with the
horizontal. The kinetic coefficient of friction for the contact between the block and
the plane is μ. What is the velocity of the block as a function of the length L it has
slid?
Identify: We use a coordinate system oriented along the plane, as illustrated in
Fig. 11.15. The block slides from position x0 , with initial velocity v0 = 0, to x1 . Our
task is to find the velocity v1 as a function of x1 .
Model: Figure 11.15 shows that the block is affected by the normal force N , friction,
f , and by gravity, G. Because the block is affected by a non-conservative force, f ,
we cannot use energy conservation to find the velocity as a function of position, but
we can still use the energy principle: The change in energy is equal to the work done
by the non-conservative forces.
ΔE = W f , (11.104)
where the change in energy is
ΔE = (K1 + U1) − (K0 + U0) = W f
0,1 . (11.105)
The work done by the constant friction force, f = −μN , is

where L = x1 − x0 is the distance moved along the plane. Because the block is not
moving in the y-direction we find the normal force from Newton’s second law:
∑ F y = N − G y = N − mg cos α = ma y = 0 , (11.107)
where Fig. 11.15 shows that G y = mg cos α. The work done by friction is therefore:
W f
0,1 = −μmgL cos α . (11.108)
To find the change in energy, ΔE, we need the change in potential energy of the
block, U1 − U0 . Since the normal force does no work, the potential energy is the
same as for motion under gravity alone: U = mgh, where h is the vertical position
of the block. Figure 11.15 shows that Δh = L sin α, and
U1 − U0 = mgΔh = −mgL sin α . (11.109)
We insert these results in ΔE = W f :
ΔE = E1 − E0 = U1 + K1 − (U0 + K0) = K1 − K0 + U1 − U0

0,1 = −mg L cos α . (11.110)
We rearrange the equation to find:

336 11 Energy
Comment: This demonstrates how to use the energy principle for practical calcula-
tions. We use the same procedure as for energy conservation, but include the work
of non-conservative forces. In most cases, we need to know the path, r(t) taken by
the object in order to calculate the work done by the non-conservative forces. This
method is therefore often not that practical.
11.5 Potential Energy in Three Dimensions
So far we have restricted ourselves to one-dimensional motions. Let us now introduce
the potential energy for a three-dimensional motion and a three-dimensional force.
We call a force F(r) conservative if the work done by the force from a point 0 to
a point 1 is independent of the path taken. That is, we call a force F(r) conservative,
if (and only if) there is a function U (r) so that:
W0 to 1 =
∫ 1
0
F(r) · dr = U (r0) − U (r1) , (11.112)
for all (possible) paths between r0 and r1 .
It is trivial to show that the work is independent of the path if a function U (r)
with the property of (11.112) exists. What about the other way—if the work along
all paths are the same, can we prove that there must exist a function U (r)? This is
also not difficult, since the function is simply defined as the work integral between
the two end-points.
How is the force F(r) and the function U (r) related? Let us look at the work done
between 0 and 1:
W =
∫ 1
0
F · dr =
∫ 1

︸ ︷︷ ︸
=−dU
= −
∫ 1
0
dU = U (r0) − U (r1) ,
(11.113)
Because U (r) = U (x, y, z), we can write:
dU (x, y, z) = ∂U
∂ x dx + ∂U
∂ y dy + ∂U
∂z dz = −Fx dx − F y dx − Fz dz , (11.114)
consequently,
Fx = − ∂U
∂ x , F y = − ∂U
∂ y , Fz = − ∂U
∂z , (11.115)
that is:
11.5 Potential Energy in Three Dimensions 337
If the force F is conservative, we can find a function U so that
F = −∇U , (11.116)
We call the function U (r) the potential energy for the force (field) F(r).
Criterion for a conservative force: This means that the criterion for a force to be
conservative is a bit stronger in two- and three-dimensions than in one dimension. In
one dimension, a force F(x) is conservative if F(x) is a function of position alone.
In two- and three-dimensions, it is a necessary condition that the force F(r) is only
a function of the position, for the force to be conservative. But it is not a sufficient
condition. There are forces F(r) that are only functions of position, but that still are
not conservative. In order for the force to be conservative, it must be the gradient of
a potential:
F = −∇U . (11.117)
From calculus, we know that a force F(r) can be written as a gradient of a
function, if and only if, the curl of F(r) is zero everywhere (for all r):
∇ × F = 0 ( for all r) , (11.118)
because in this case, the integral of all closed curves is zero.
11.5.1 Example: Constant Gravity in Three Dimensions
Problem: Find the potential energy U (r) for the gravitational force G = −mg j.
Solution: We want to find a function U (r) that satisfies:
G = −mg j = −∇U , (11.119)
Let us try the solution we already know from one dimension:
U (x, y, z) = mgy , (11.120)
We find the gradient of U :
338 11 Energy
∇U =
( ∂
∂ x i + ∂
∂ y j + ∂
∂z k
)
(mgy) (11.121)
= ∂
∂ x mgy i + ∂
∂ y mgy j + ∂
∂z mgy k = 0 i + mg j + 0 k . (11.122)
This means that the graviational force G is the gradient of the potential U = mgy,
that U = mgy is a potential energy (function) also in three dimensions, and that the
constant gravitational force is conservative.
11.5.2 Example: Gravity in Three Dimensions
Problem: The gravitational force on an object of mass m at position r from an object
of mass M in the origin is:
F = − Gm M
r2
r
r . (11.123)
Is this force conservative, and can you find the potential energy for this force?
Approach: We know that the force is conservative if the work on the object (of
mass m) does not depend on the path. Let us find the work done along a path, and
demonstrate that it is only dependent on the displacement and not on the path.
Solution: The work done on an object when it is moved along a path r(t) from
r(t0) = r0 to r(t1) = r1 is:
W0,1 =
∫ 1
0
F · dr =
∫ 1
0
− Gm M
r3 r · dr (11.124)
We introduce a common trick for such integrals: We use that d(r · r) = 2r · dr, and
therefore that r · dr = d ((1/2)r · r), and write the integral as:
W0,1 =
∫ 1
0
− Gm M
r3 d

= −Gm M
∫ r1
r0
d( 1
2 r2)
r3 = −Gm M
∫ r1
r0
r
r3 dr
(11.125)
This integral does not depend on the path, only on the end-points. The gravitational
force is therefore conservative.
We solve the integral to find the potential energy function:
W0,1 = −Gm M
∫ r1
r0
dr
r2 = − Gm M
r0
+ Gm M
r1
= U (r0) − U (r1) . (11.126)
The potential energy function is therefore:
U (r) = − Gm M
r . (11.127)
11.5 Potential Energy in Three Dimensions 339
Analyze: We can check this result by calculating the gradient of the potential energy
function:
∇U (r) = −Gm M ∇ 1
r = −Gm M

And similarly for the y and the z components. This shows that:
∇U = Gm M
r3 r = −F , (11.130)
which proves that U (r) is the potential energy function for the gravitational energy.
11.5.3 Example: Non-conservative Force Field
Problem: Show that the force:
F = −y i + x j , (11.131)
is not conservative, even though it depends on the position r alone.
Approach: We can prove that the force is not conservative in several ways. First,
we recall the definition of a conservative force: A force is conservative if the work
done by the force from point 0 to a point 1 is independent of the path. Our plan
is to calculate the work along two different paths. If they are not the same we can
conclude that the force is not conservative.
Solution: We study two different paths, A and B, from r0 = x0 i + y0 j = 0 to
r1 = x1 i + y1 j as illustrated in Fig. 11.16. Let us calculate the work done along each
path:
Path A: Path A goes as a straight line first from (0, 0) to (x1, 0) (path A1), and then
from (x1, 0) to (x1, y1) (path A2). The work alongthese two subpaths are:
W A1 =

The work done by F along path A is therefore:
W A = W A1 + W A2 = 0 + x1 y1 = x1 y1 . (11.134)
Path B: Path B goes as a straight line first from (0, 0) to (0, y1) (path B1), and then
from (0, y1) to (x1, y1) (path B2). The work along these two subpaths are:

The work done by F along path B is therefore:
W B = W B1 + W B2 = 0 − x1 y1 = −x1 y1 . (11.137)
We see that the work done by F along the two paths A and B between the two points
0 and 1 are not the same. The work therefore depends on the path, and the force is
not conservative!
Analyze: The force is conservative if and only if it can be written as the gradient
of a potential. A necessary condition for that, is that the curl of F is zero. We can
therefore alos determine is the force is conservative by calculating the curl of F:

The force is therefore not conservative.
11.6 Energy Conservation as a Test of Numerical Solutions
When we are solving the equations of motion based on Newton’s second law, we
can use our general knowledge of physics to check the results. This is what we do
when we first look at the result of a calculation: If it is obviously wrong, we dismiss
it immediately. For example, if you study a falling raindrop with air resistance,
you know something is wrong if you calculation tells you the drop is accelerating
upwards. Our physical intuition is therefore important both for the interpretation of
the results, but also for evaluating their correctness. However, we can leverage our
knowledge of physics further. For example, we can use conservation laws to test the
accuracy of our solutions and of our solution methods. This is common practice for
working physicists, and should be a part of your regular professional routine: Always
check for energy (and later momentuum) conservation!
Spring-block system: Let us demonstrate this through a simple example: A spring-
block system with a block (m = 0.1 kg) attached to a spring (k = 1000 N/m). We
assume that the block is moving along the x-axis and that it is in equilibrium when
x = 0. If the force from the spring is the only force acting on the block Newton’s
second law gives: ∑ Fx = −kx = ma ⇒ a = −kx . (11.139)
Let us calculate the motion starting from x(t0) = 0 m with a velocity v(t0) = v0 .
Euler-method solution: In this case we know the exact solution of this equation.
However, let us now rather analyze our numerical solution methods. We start by
using Euler’s method. We find the velocity and position at time ti+1 = ti + Δt from
the velocity and position at time ti using:
v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + a(ti ) Δt
x(ti + Δt) = x(ti ) + v(ti ) Δt (11.140)
This method is implemented in the following program:
from pylab import *
m = 0.1 # kg
k = 1000 # N/m
x0 = 0.0 # m
v0 = 1.0 # m/s
time = 1.0 # s

n = 100000
dt = time/n
t = zeros(n,float)
x = zeros(n,float)
v = zeros(n,float)
x[0] = x0
t[0] = 0.0
v[0] = v0
for i in range(n-1):
F = -k*x[i]
a = F/m
v[i+1] = v[i] + dt*a
x[i+1] = x[i] + dt*v[i]
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
plot(t,x); xlabel(’t (s)’), ylabel(’x (m)’)
Validation: The resulting motion is shown in Fig. 11.17. However, if we did not know
the exact solution for the motion, it would be difficult to evaluate if this solution is
correct. Let us therefore check the solution by calculating the total energy of the block.
Because the block is affected by only one force, which depends on the position of
the block alone, the total energy of the block is conserved. In this case we know the
potential energy of the block:
U (x) = 1
2 kx2 . (11.141)

11.6 Energy Conservation as a Test of Numerical Solutions 343
The total energy is therefore:
E = U (x) + K = 1
2 kx2 + 1
2 mv2 . (11.142)
This quantity should be conserved. We calculate and plot the energy in the program
by adding the following lines:
U = 0.5*k*x**2
K = 0.5*m*v**2
E = U + K
plot(t,E), xlabel(’t (s)’), ylabel(’E (J)’)
The result in Fig. 11.17 shows that the energy is not conserved. Something may
be wrong. We know that we always make errors in our numerical integration due to
numerical rounding. Could this be a result of numerical round-off errors? In addition,
we know that the numerical scheme is not exact itself. It is only valid in the limit
when Δt goes to zero and in this limit the effect of round-off error will be important.
Discussion: First, we notice that the errors are rather large. We would expect round-
off errors to be related to the smallest numbers represented on the machine, and not
on the order of 1 % of the value of the energy. However, it is often easier to check if the
error is related to the numerical algorithm—we simply reduce the value of Δt and see
what happens. Figure 11.17 shows that when Δt is reduced, the error is also reduced.
We therefore conclude that the main contribution to the error we are observing comes
from the numerical method. Our numerical scheme is not conserving energy for this
equation. This is, unfortunately, a well-known problem with Euler’s method: The
error in the numerical solution to even a simple problem like a block in a spring
increases with time.
Euler-Cromer method solution: We can fix this by introducing a higher-order
method such as Euler-Cromer’s method. This is done by a simple modification of
the numerical scheme:
v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + a(ti ) Δt
x(ti + Δt) = x(ti ) + v(ti + Δt) Δt (11.143)
This method is implemented by exchanging a single line in the program:
x[i+1] = x[i] + dt*v[i]
with
x[i+1] = x[i] + dt*v[i+1]
and the resulting plot of E(t) is shown in Fig. 11.18. Now, the energy does not
diverge, but instead oscillates around the theoretical, constant value. The amplitude
of the oscillations decrease with Δt. This indicates that the solution method we have
used now is sound.

Summary
Conservative forces: A force F is conservative if the work done by the force only
depends on the end-points of the motion. That is, if the work is independent of
the path.
Potential energy: For a conservative force F we can write the work from r0 to r1 as
a function of the end points:
W =
∫ 1
0
F · dr = U (r0) − U (r1)
The quantity U (r) is called the potential energy and is a positional energy.
Potential energy function in one dimension: For a one-dimensional force, the force
is conservative if and only if it only depends on the position. The force can be written
as the derivative of the potential energy U (x):
F = − dU
dx
Potential energy function in three dimension: For a three-dimensional force, the
force is conservative if and only if the force can be written as the gradient of a field
U :
F = −∇U ,
That is F must depend on the position r only, and ∇ × F = 0 as well.
Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy of an object is defined as:
K = 1
2 mv2 .
11.6 Energy Conservation as a Test of Numerical Solutions 345
Mechanical energy: The mechanical energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic
and the potential energy:
E = K + U
Conservation of mechanical energy: If an object is only subject to conservative
forces, the mechanical energy is conserved throughout the motion:
K (r0) + U (r0) = K (r1) + U (r1)
Energy diagrams: An energy diagram illustrates the potential and kinetic energy
for an object as a function of position based on a plot of the potential energy U (x).
The potential energy can be interpreted as an energy landscape for the motion. A
motion with constant mechanical energy, E = U + K , is illustrated by a horizontal
line in this plot.
Equilibrium points: An equilibrium point occurs where the force is zero. This
corresponds to a local extremum of the potential energy. An equilibrium point is
stable in a local minimum and unstable in a local maximum.
Kinetic energy in energy diagrams: The kinetic energy can be found from the plot
as the distance from the potential energy up to the line giving the total energy, E.
An object cannot have negative kinetic energy and therefore cannot enter a region
where the total energy is less than the potential energy.
The energy principle: The energy principle states that
ΔE = W N C .
A change in (mechanical) energy of an object is equal to the work done by non-
conservative forces, W N C .
Non-conservative forces: The energy principle can be used in reverse: The work
done by non-conservative forces is equal to the change in mechanical energy:
W N C =
∫ t1
t0
FN C · vdt = (K (r1) + U (r1)) − (K (r0) + U (r0)) .

Projects
11.15 Shooting Ions. In this project you will apply you knowledge of potential
energy to find the force law for the collision between an ion and a molecule, and
apply this to address the motion of the ions through the collision, integrating the
equations of motion in two dimensions.
11.6 Energy Conservation as a Test of Numerical Solutions 349
We will study the motion of a small ion with mass m that is shot toward a massive
molecule located in the origin. The molecule is so large that you can assume that
it does not move throughout the whole process. We start by a simplified case, and
address a one-dimensional motion along the x-axis. The interaction between the ion
and the molecule is described by the potential:
U (x) = C
x , (11.145)
where C is a know constant, and x is the position of the ion. The ion starts at the
position x = b with the velocity v0 , where b > 0 and v0 < 0. You can ignore all
other forces acting on the ion.
(a) Sketch the potential, find equilibrium points and characterize these. Show the
motion of the ion in the energy diagram, and describe the motion of the ion.
(b) How close to the origin does the ion get?
(c) What is the velocity of the ion when it is infinitely far away from the origin?
Let us now address the same process, but in two dimensions. We assume that the
ion starts in the position r0 = (b, d), where b and d are two given lengths. You
may assume that d is less than b, as illustrated in Fig. 11.22. The ion starts with the
velocity v0 = (v0, 0), where v0 < 0. The potential energy for the ion due to the
interaction with the molecule is now:
U (r) = C
r , (11.146)
where r = |r|. You can neglect all other interactions.

Chapter 12
Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
Two galaxies collide, leading to millions and millions of stars interacting. Can we
say anything general about such a collision? For example, if you know the galaxies
velocities after the collision, what can you learn about their velocities before the
collision?
We have started to study the consequences of Newton’s laws of motion. Our
first discovery is the conservation of mechanical energy. For an object subject only
to conservative forces, the mechanical energy is conserved. Energy conservation
provides a useful tool when solving problems in mechanics: we can relate the velocity
and position of an object without having to find the position as a function of time.
This is particularly useful when the interactions are complicated, and we have limited
knowledge about the forces between objects. Actually, it allows us to reason about
the behavior of a system without having force models, as long as we know that the
forces are conservative.
Conservation of mechanical energy: The conservation of mechanical energy is an
example of a conservation law, which we found by integrating Newton’s second law
along the path:
∫ t1
t0
Fnet · vdt = ΔK . (12.1)
For a one-dimensional motion where the net force only depends on the position, x,
we get:
∫ x1
x0
Fnet
x dx = ΔK = 1
2 mv2
1 − 1
2 mv2
0 . (12.2)
If we could calculate the integral on the left, we could find the velocity as a function
of position without finding the complete motion.

352 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
Conservation of momentuum: This techinque is sometimes called an integration
method. To get energy conservation we integrated Newton’s second law over space.
But we can also integrate Newton’s second law over time:
∫ t1
t0
Fnetdt =
∫ t1
t0
madt = mv1 − mv0 . (12.3)
If the integral on the left is zero, that is, if the net force is zero, then we find that mv
does not change. This gives us another conservation law: Conservation of momentum,
mv. But how can that be useful? Didn’t we already know from Newton’s first law
that if the net external force is zero, the velocity does not change? It turns out that
conservation of momentum is not that useful for a single object, but it is very useful
for systems consisting of several objects. For systems of several objects, we will
demonstrate that the total momentum is conserved if there are no external forces
acting on the system. It does not matter what internal forces are acting, the total
momentum is conserved at all times as long as there are no external forces.
Collisions: Conservation of momentum is particularly useful for collisions. During
a collision between two objects, the interactions between the objects can be very
complicated, and may consist of both conservative and non-conservative forces, but
as long as the objects are not affected by any external forces, their total momentum is
conserved. We use this to find the velocities of each object after a collision from the
velocities before a collision, without finding the motion of each object. Conservation
of momentum is more general than the conservation of energy, since it is valid for
any internal force, and not only for conservative forces.
Overview: In order to introduce these concepts, we will start by introducing tranla-
tional momentum, p = mv. We reformulate Newton’s second law using momentum,
and find that the integral of the net forces acting on an object corresponds to the
change of momentum. We will then use these concepts to address systems with
several objects, with a particular focus on collisions.
12.1 Motivating Example—Meteor Impact
You are now an expert solver of mechanics problems: Given a set of force models,
you can find the motion of an object from Newton’s second law of motion using
analytical or numerical tools. However, in some cases we may not know (or care to
model) the detailed forces acting between two objects, but you still would like to
know what happens to the objects. For example, you may observe a large meteor
head directly towards a small planet. You know the masses and velocities of both

Fig. 12.1 Illustration a collision between a meteor and a planet
objects at some time before the collision, and want to know the velocity of the planet
after the hit. Can you do that without having a detailed model for the collision? 1
Identify: The meteor impact is illustrated in Fig. 12.1. We describe the meteor (object
A) with its position rA(t) and its mass m A, and the motion of the planet (object B)
with its position rB (t) and its mass m B . At some time t0 before the impact you know
the velocities of both objects, vA(t0) = vA,0 and vB (t0) = vB,0 .
Model: You know you can find the motion of both objects by applying Newton’s
second law to get an equation of motion. If we assume that the only interactions are
between the planet and the meteor, Newton’s second law for objects A and B are:
Fnet
A = Ffrom B on A = m AaA
Fnet
B = Ffrom A on B = m B aB
. (12.4)
Unfortunately, we do not have a simple force model for the force from the meteor
on the planet during the collision. How can we then solve the problem?
Using Newton’s third law: Fortunately, we can use a common trick: We know that
the force from the meteor on the planet is the reaction force to the force from the
planet on the meteor: Newton’s third law tells us that:
Ffrom A on B = −Ffrom B on A = F . (12.5)
1 A model for such a collision would be very complicated, as there are many different processes
involved.
354 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
We can therefore rewrite Newton’s second law in (12.4) to be:
m AaA = −F
m B aB = F (12.6)
which is valid as long as there are no other forces acting on the meteor or the planet.
Now, we see that we can get rid of the unknown force, F, altogether by adding the
two equations, getting:
m AaA + m B aB = −F + F = 0 . (12.7)
Integration method: Now, we can integrate this equation, from the initial time t0 ,
where we know the velocities, to the
∫ t1
t0
m AaA + m B aB dt = 0 , (12.8)
m A
∫ t1
t0
aA dt + m B
∫ t1
t0
aB dt = 0 , (12.9)
m A (vA(t1) − vA(t0)) + m B (vB (t1) − vB (t0)) = 0 . (12.10)
Let us now group the quantities relating to t1 on the left side, and the quantities
relating to t0 on the right side:
m AvA(t1) + m B vB (t1) = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0) . (12.11)
This looks like what we have previously found for energy: It is a conservation law.
But for what? For the quantity:
P = m AvA + m B vB , (12.12)
which we call the total momentum of the system consisting of the planet and the
meteor.
Solve: How can we use (12.11) to find the velocity of the planet and the meteor after
the collision? First, we notice that (12.11) actually is valid for all times, also at any
time during the collision. But it is not sufficient to find the velocities of each object
after the collision. We only know what the awkward sum, m AvA + m B vB is after the
collision. We do not know how this sum is distributed between the two objects. But
since this is meteor impact we know something else, we know that the two objects
move as one object after the collision: The meteor and the planet have the same
velocity afterwards:
vA(t1) = vB (t1) = v1 . (12.13)
12.1 Motivating Example—Meteor Impact 355
Now, we can determine the velocity after the collision. Starting from (12.11) we
have:
m AvA(t1) + m B vB (t1) = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0)
m Av1 + m B v1 = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0)
(m A + m B ) v1 = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0) (12.14)
v1 = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0)
m A + m B
We have found the velocity of the planet and the meteor after the collision, without
solving the equations of motion!
Discussion: The method we applied here is very similar to the energy conservation
method, but it is based on a different conservation law. But notice that we could not
have found the velocity after the collision, if we did not know that the objects were
moving with the same velocity after the collision. Since the equation we have used
here, conservation of momentum, only provides one equation, we cannot use it to
find two velocities. We need more equations. We therefore need to know something
more about the collision. For example, we may use that the energy is conserved
during the collision, or that we know how much energy is lost during the collision.
In the remaining of this chapter we will more thoroughly introduce the concepts
briefly mentioned here, and apply the concepts systematically to study two-particle
and multi-particle collisions.
12.2 Translational Momentum
The translational momentum of an object is defined as:
p = mv , (12.15)
The translational momentum is a property of the object that depends on both the
objects inertial mass, m, and the objects velocity, v. The translational momentum is
often also called the linear momentum. We prefer the term translational momentum to
discern it from rotational momentum, which we encounter when discussing rotational
motion. In the following we use the short term momentum instead of translational
momentum.
The translational momentum of an object is a vector, which is in contrast to
energy, which is a scalar. Translational momentum is a general property that may be
extended also to particles without mass. For example, photons have a translational
momentum even though they have no mass.
356 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
Newton’s Second Law
We have previously introduced Newton’s second law of motion as:
∑
j
Fext
j = ma . (12.16)
However, the most fundamental, and the original, form of Newton’s second law is:
∑
j
Fext
j = d
dt p , (12.17)
The net force acting on an object causes a change in the momentum of the object.2
For an object with constant mass, this formulation reduces to the original formu-
lation: ∑
j
Fext
j = d
dt p = d
dt (mv) = dm
dt︸︷︷︸
=0
v + m dv
dt = ma . (12.18)
This law is a fundamental principle in physics, on the same level as the energy-
principle. It is the general formulation of Newton’s second law, and we use the term
Newton’s second law for this law as well as the special case when the mass is constant.
12.3 Impulse and Change in Momentum
What is causing a change in the momentum of an object? Let us study an object that
is affected by a force during a short time interval, such as a tennis ball during a serve.
While the ball is in contact with the racket, the contact force F(t) on the ball varies
as illustrated in Fig. 12.2. When the racket makes contact with the ball, the contact
force is small, but it grows rapidly as the racket deforms against the ball. As the ball
speeds up, the force decreases while the racket returns to its original shape, until the
force reaches zero as the ball leaves the racket.
During the collision, other forces such as gravitational forces are negligible com-
pared with the contact force from the racket. We can therefore assume that the contact
force F(t) is approximately equal to the net force on the ball.
The change of momentum of the ball from the time t0 before contact with the
racket to the time t1 after the ball has left the racket is
Δp = p2 − p1 =
∫ t1
t0
dp
dt dt =
∫ t1
t0
F(t) dt . (12.19)
2 This formulation of Newton’s second law can also be exteded to relativistic mechanics.

being hit by a tennis racket,
showing an illustration of the
collision as a function of
time, and a plot of the force
F(t) from the racket on the
ball as a function of time
t
F(t)
The left side is the change in momentum of the ball. The right side includes both the
strength of the interaction—the force F—and the duration of the interaction. We call
this quantity the impulse, J, experienced by the object during the collision:
Impulse:
J =
∫ t1
t0
Fnet(t) dt . (12.20)
If the direction of the net force F(t) does not change during the collision, the impulse
is directed in the same direction as F(t). In this case, the impulse, J , is the area under
the curve, F(t), in Fig. 12.2.
Time-Averaged Force
Unfortunately, we generally do not know the time dependency of the net force, since
this requires a detailed force model for the collision, or a detailed measurement of
the forces acting. Instead, we can use our knowledge of the change in momentum to
determine the average force acting on the ball during the collision. The time-average
force is defined as:
Fnet
avg = 〈Fext(t)〉 = 1
t1 − t0
∫ t1
t0
F(t) dt . (12.21)
where Δt = t1 − t0 is the duration of the collision. We define the start of the collision
as the time t0 when the ball comes in contact with the racket (when the contact force
becomes non-zero), and the end of the collision as the time t1 when the ball loses
contact with the racket (when the contact force becomes zero). We recognize the

Momentum Change During a Collision
The momentum change during a collision gives useful insight into the collision:
While the net force may vary throughout the collision, and the maximum force may
be much larger than the average force, the average force is still a reasonable estimate
for the force acting on the object. For example, if we want to estimate the damage
done to an object during a collision, the average force is a good estimate also of the
maximum force, because for most physical interactions (for most force models), the
force does not display a very narrow peak, but instead varies gradually over a wider
time interval, and hence the maximum force is often just a few times the maximum
force. (See Fig. 12.3 for an illustration).
Test your understanding: You jump down from a window 5 meters above the ground. How should
you land in order to minimize the force on you from the ground? What determines the change in
momentum during the impact? Demonstrate that you can answer this question using both energy
and momentum considerations.

You can neglect air drag. Find the motion of the ball and visualize the change in
momentum during the collision.
Model: We describe the motion of the ball by its vertical position, y(t). The ball is
affected by two forces, the contact force N and gravity, G, as illustrated in Fig. 12.4,
where we have neglected air drag.
We find the acceleration of the ball from Newton’s second law. The forces acting
on the ball are the contact force from the surface and gravity:
ma = Fnet = N − mg ⇒ a = 1
m N − g . (12.24)
Solve: The ball starts at y(t0)y0 with the velocity v(t0) = v0 . While we may be able
to find the motion y(t) analytically, a numerical approach based on Euler-Cromer’s
method is sufficient. This is implemented in the following program:
from pylab import *

Figure 12.5 illustrates a simulation with this model. Here, you can see the time
development of the net force and the momentum of the ball throughout the collision.
Change in momentum: What is the change in momentum of the ball? Since the force
only depends on the position of the ball, the force is conservative and the mechanical
energy of the ball is conserved throughout the collision. Hence, the kinetic energy
of the ball is the same when the ball comes in contact with the surface and when it
loses contact with the surface, since the vertical position is the same:
E0 = U (y0) + 1
2 mv2
0 = E1 = U (y1) + 1
2 mv2
1 , (12.25)
where y0 = y1 and therefore 1
2 mv2
0 = 1
2 mv2
1 , (12.26)
which gives v1 = −v0 , since we know that the velocity after the collision is in the
opposite direction of the velocity before the collision.
12.3 Impulse and Change in Momentum 361
The change in momentum is therefore
Δp = mv1 − mv0 = m(−v0) − mv0 = −2mv0 = −2 p0 . (12.27)
If we know the duration, Δt, of the collision, we can find the average net force on
the ball during the collision from
Fnet
avg = −2mv0
Δt . (12.28)
12.3.2 Example: Hitting a Tennis Ball
Problem: A tennis ball of mass 57 g is approaching you with a horizontal velocity
v0 = 20 m/s. You hit the ball, returning it with a horizontal velocity v1 = 20 m/s,
now in the opposite direction. (a) What is the impulse J on the ball while it is in
contact with the racket during the collision? (b) The ball and racket are in contact
for 2.0 ms. What is the average net force on the racket during the collision? (c) You
want to return the ball as a high lob and give the ball a velocity v1 = 15 m/s at angle
of 45◦ upward. What is now the impulse on the ball and the net force from the racket
on the ball?
Approach: We may solve this problem by determining the motion of the ball from
Newton’s laws of motion, but this would require a detailed force model for the force
from the tennis racket on the ball. In this case, we do not have such a model. Instead,
we want to use the measured change in velocity to determine the average force on
the ball.
Identify: In this problem we address the motion of the tennis ball, described by the
position r(t). The ball starts with the velocity v0 = −v0 i at the time t0 (before the
collision), and gets the velocity v1 after the collision.
Model: The ball is affected by a force, F(t), from the racket on the ball, and by
gravity. However, we assume that gravity is small compared with the typical force
from the racket, and ignore the effects of gravity.
Solve: The impulse is defined as the integral of the net force on the ball, and it is
equal to the change in momentum of the ball:
J = Δp = p1 − p0 = mv1 − mv0 , (12.29)
Solution part a: In part (a) of the problem, the final velocity is v1 = v1 i. The key
idea is that momentum is a vector quantity. The ball therefore experiences a change in
momentum, even though the magnitude of the momentum does not change, because
the direction of the momentum changes.
362 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
The impulse on the ball in the collision is:
J = m (v1 i − (−v0 i)) = m(v1 + v0) i (12.30)
= 0.057 kg (20.0 m/s + 20.0 m/s) i = 2.28 kg m/s i . (12.31)
The impulse is positive, since the force acting on the ball is in the positive x-
direction—this is also the direction of the acceleration of the ball.
Solution of part b: In part (b) of the problem, we find the average force from the
change in momentum during the collision:
Favg = 1
Δt
∫ t1
t0
Fdt = Δp
Δt = 2.28 kg m/s
2 10−3 s = 1140N , (12.32)
This is the average net force on the ball. We recall from Fig. 12.3 that the net force
is smaller than the maximum force, although they are typically of comparable mag-
nitude.
Dicussion: What about gravity? We neglected gravity because we assumed it to be
small compared with the force from the racket. We could check this assumption in
two ways. First, we could check that the impulse of gravity is much smaller than the
total impulse on the ball—we can do this without calculating the average force. The
magnitude of gravity is:
W = mg = 0.057 kg 9.8 m/s 2 = 0.56 N . (12.33)
The impulse of gravity is therefore:
Jg = mgΔt = 0.56 M 2 10−3 s = 1.1 10−2 kg m/s , (12.34)
which is much smaller than the impulse of the net force.
From this calculation we also found the force from gravity, which is much smaller
than the average net force on the ball. We were therefore right in neglecting the effect
of gravity.
Solution to part c: Finally, we address question (c), where the collision is not head
on, and the ball leaves the racket at an angle α, as illustrated in Fig. 12.6. In this case,
we need to treat the collision as two-dimensional. First, we introduce the velocity of
the ball after the collision as:
v1 = v1 (cos α i + sin α j) , (12.35)
where v1 = 15 m/s and α = 45◦ = π/4. The impulse on the ball is still given as the
change in momentum:
J = p1 − p0 = m (v1 − v0) . (12.36)
12.3 Impulse and Change in Momentum 363

We find the x- and y-components of the impulse:
Jx = J · i = m (v x,1 − v x,0
) = 57 g (15 cos α + 20) m/s = 1.74 kg m/s (12.37)
J y = J · j = m (v x,1 − v x,0
) = 57 g (15 sin α − 0) m/s = 0.60 kg m/s . (12.38)
The impulse is therefore:
J = 1.74 kg m/s i + 0.60 kg m/s j , (12.39)
The force is given as the impulse divided by the time interval. We assume the time
interval to be the same for this process, Δt = 2 ms. The average net force is therefore:
Favg = J
Δt = 1.74 kg m/s i + 0.60 kg m/s j
2 10−3 s = 870 N i + 300 N j , (12.40)
Interestingly, this means that the direction of the net force is in the direction β:
β = tan−1 F y
Fx
= 19◦ . (12.41)
12.4 Isolated Systems and Conservation of Momentum
During a collision between two objects the forces acting between the objects generally
have a complicated time dependence—the curve of F(t) is non-trivial. It is therefore
not a simple task to calculate the impulse integral and use this to determine the
change in momentum of the objects. Fortunately, it turns out that the problem can be
significantly simplified for an isolated system where the net external force is zero.
In this case the total momentum of the system is conserved throughout the collision.
The total momentum is therefore the same before and after the collision. This is a
powerful principle we use to analyze complex interactions without determining the
detailed motion and forces in the system.
364 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
Momentum and Motion of Two Objects
We will now demonstrate that the total momentum is conserved when there are no
external forces by discussing the collision between two objects A and B, illustrated in
Fig. 12.7. We know that we can determine the motion of each object from Newton’s
second law of motion applied to each of the objects. For each object we separate the
forces into external forces, forces having an origin outside the system, and internal
forces, forces that are acting between the two objects:
Internal forces act between the objects in the system.
External forces act between objects in the system and the environment.
For the collision in Fig. 12.7 the only internal forces are the forces between the
objects: The force from A on B and the reaction force from B on A. With this
notation, Newton’s second law for object A can be written as:
∑ FA = ∑ Fext
A + FB on A = dpA
dt , (12.42)
where the sum is over all the external forces acting on object A. Similarly, Newton’s
second law for object B is:
∑ FB = ∑ Fext
B + FA on B = dpB
dt , (12.43)
where we again have summed over all the external forces acting on object B. Now,
we do not want to address the internal forces acting between A and B. How can we

12.4 Isolated Systems and Conservation of Momentum 365
get rid of them in these equations? There is a commonly used trick: we recall from
Newton’s thirds law that the reaction force FA on B is equal, but oppositely directed
to FB on A:
FA on B = −FB on A , (12.44)
If we insert this into (12.43), we get two equations for the motion of object A and B:
∑ Fext
A + FB on A = dpA
dt
∑ Fext
B − FB on A = dpB
dt (12.45)
If we add the equations, we get rid of the internal forces, FB on A:
∑ Fext
A + ∑ Fext
B = dpA
dt + dpB
dt , (12.46)
We introduce the sum over all the external forces on all the objects in the system:
Over all the forces acting on object A and all the forces acting on object B:
∑ Fext = ∑ Fext
A + ∑ Fext
B . (12.47)
We use this to simplify (12.46):
∑ Fext = d
dt (pA + pB ) . (12.48)
We call the sum of the momenta for each of the objects the total momentum of the
system:
Total momentum:
P = ∑ p = pA + pB , (12.49)
This provides a generalization of Newton’s second law for a two-particle-system:
Generalization of Newton’s second law:
∑ Fext = d
dt
∑ p = d
dt (pA + pB ) , (12.50)
366 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
This law is completely general. We have not made any assumptions about the in-
teractions between the two objects. The internal and external forces may be of any
kind, conservative or non-conservative. The law is valid in all cases.
Conservation of Momentum in Isolated Systems
As a special case of this law, we observe that if the net external force on the system
is zero (or negligible), the total momentum of the system is conserved:
∑ Fext = 0 ⇒ d
dt (pA + pB ) = 0 . (12.51)
We call a system isolated if the net external force is zero (or negligible):
An isolated system is a collection of objects that may interact internally, but
where the net external force on all the objects is zero (or negligible).
For an isolated system, the total momentum is conserved:
pA + pB = constant (for an isolated system) . (12.52)
• This is a completely general law for the conservation of momentum of a system.
It only requires the net external force on the system to be zero. It is valid not only
at the beginning and at the end of the collision, but at all times during the collision
as well.
• Notice: A common mistake is to forget the absolutely necessary condition that the
net external force on the system must be zero (or negligible). Whenever you employ
this law, you should make a habit of always asking yourself if the net external force
is zero, or if it is reasonable to neglect it compared with other forces.
• Notice that the conservation law is a vector equation, and that it can be valid in
one direction independently of an orthogonal direction. If the net external force
in the x-direction is zero, the total momentum in this direction is conserved even
though there is a net external force in the y-direction.
• Notice that it is not only valid for contact forces, as illustrated in Fig. 12.7, but for
any type of force, including long-reaching forces such as gravity. The gravitational
forces between object in the system are internal forces, while gravitational forces
between objects in the system and objects outside the system are external forces.

Conservation of Total Momentum During a Collision
The conservation of total momentum during the collision between objects A and B
is illustrated in Fig. 12.8. The arrows indicate the momentum of each object and the
plots show the momentum in the x- and y-direction for each object and the total
momentum. Since there are only internal forces acting in this system, there are no
external forces affecting either object, and the total momentum is conserved in both
the x- and the y-direction.
Conservation of Total Momentum During a Collision
with an External Force
What happens if we addressed the same collision, but also include a gravitational
force in the y-direction for both objects? As illustrated in Fig. 12.9, the behavior looks
similar: The force as a function of time, F(t), is similar, and the total momentum
in the x-direction is conserved. However, the momentum in the y-direction is not
conserved. It is decreasing throughout the motion due to the external force, gravity,
acting on both object A and object B.

figures show the momentum p x (t) and p y (t) as a function of time. The total momentum (dotted
line) is constant in the x-direction, but is changing in the y-direction due to the net force from
gravity affecting the objects
How large is the effect of an external force, like gravity in this case? The change
in momentum is given by the impulse of the external forces:
ΔP = Jext =
∫ t1
t0
Fextdt , (12.53)
To determine the effect of the external forces, we therefore need to compare the
change of momentum due to the external force, ΔP, to the total momentum of the
system, P. For the gravitational force G = −mgæ, the impulse of gravity is:
JG,y =
∫ t1
t0
(−m A g − m B g) dt = − (m A + m B ) Δt , (12.54)
and the total momentum in the y-direction of the whole system,
Py = p A,y + p B,y = m A v A,0,y + m B v B,0,y . (12.55)
12.4 Isolated Systems and Conservation of Momentum 369
If JG  Py , the impulse of the external forces are negligible during the collision, and
we can assume that momentum is approximately conserved. Notice that the impulse
depends on the duration of the collision, Δt. If the collision takes a short time, the
momentum change due to the external forces will be small during the collision, and
the momentum will be approximately conserved from the beginning to the end of
the collision. This is why we often assume that collisions are instantaneous. Then
we may assume that the impulse due to external forces is small compared with the
total momentum, and therefore that the total momentum is approximately conserved
in the collision.
Conservation of Momentum for Multi-particle Systems
The generalization of Newton’s law can be extended to any number of objects. For
a system with N objects, the total momentum is:
P =
N∑
j=1
p j , (12.56)
and the generalization of Newton’s second law is:
∑ Fext = d
dt P = d
dt
N∑
j=1
p j . (12.57)
The derivation follows the same principles used for two particle system: Also for the
N -particle system Newton’s third law ensures that all internal forces come in pairs
that cancel each other, so that the sum of all the internal forces is zero.
12.5 Collisions
The conservation of momentum allows us to determine the velocities of objects
after a collision from the velocities before a collision without knowing the details
of the interactions during the collision: We can get by without solving the complete
equations of motion, even without knowing the details of the interactions, for all
the objects. Let us therefore apply the law we have introduced, the conservation of
momentum for isolated systems, to address collisions, first in one dimension and
then in two and three dimensions.
What is a collision? For our purposes, a collision between two objects is a process
where large forces are acting between the two objects over a short time interval:
370 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
A collision between two or more objects is a process
• where the internal forces between the objects are much larger than the ex-
ternal forces from the environment
• that occur over a short time interval compared to the time scale of the motion.
Collisions Along a Line
We start from the simplest case: a one-dimensional collision between two blocks
moving along a line. We want to find the velocities of the objects after the collision.
Blocks A and B with masses m A and m B slide along a horizontal, frictionless straight
track. Before the collision, the x-component of the velocities of the blocks are v A,0
and v B,0 . The blocks collide during a short time interval Δt. What are their velocities
after the collision? The process is illustrated in Fig. 12.10.
We assume that the net external force in the x-direction is zero. Hence, the mo-
mentum in the x-direction is conserved, and the total momentum P is the same before
and after the collision:
P0 = P1
p A,0 + p B,0 = p A,1 + p B,1
m A v A,0 + m B v B,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 . (12.58)
This equation holds at any time during the collision. Unfortunately, we cannot find the
velocities after the collision from this equations alone, because there are two unknown
velocities, v A,1 , and v B,1 , but only one equation. We need more information about
the process—we need an additional equation!
We need to know more about the collision process to find another relation between
the initial and the final velocities. For example, if we know that all the forces acting
between the objects are conservative, we would get an additional equation from the
conservation of mechanical energies. If the objects are not interacting, which is the
case before and after, but not during the collision, the total energy is equal to the
kinetic energies plus a constant potential energy (because the potential energies are
constant when the objects are not interacting):

2 m B v2
B,0 + U0 = 1
2 m A v2
A,1 + 1
2 m B v2
B,1 + U1 , (12.59)
where U0 = U1 . In this case, we would have two equations and two unknowns,
and we can find one (or a few) unique solutions, which gives us the values of the
velocities after the collision.

Conservation of mechanical energy is one possibility. Many things can happen
between the objects during a collision, which may give rise to other relations and
other equations relating the initial and the final velocities. It is customary to describe
collisions by their degree of energy conservation, ranging from elastic collisions,
where mechanical energy is conserved, through various inelastic collisions where
mechanical energy is not conserved, to a perfectly inelastic collision, which corre-
sponds to the maximum loss of mechanical energy while still conserving momentum.
We discuss these situations in the following.
372 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
Coefficient of Restitution
The energy loss in a collision between two objects is often described by the coefficient
of restitution, r. For example, we can characterize the collision between a ball and a
massive wall by the velocity, v1 , of the ball after the collision:
v1 = −rv0 , (12.60)
as a function of the velocity v0 before the collision. The change in kinetic energy is:
E1 − E0 = 1
2 mv2
1 − 1
2 mv2
0 = (r2 − 1)E0 , (12.61)
This gives the following cases:
• A collision is called elastic if the mechanical energy is conserved. This corresponds
to r = 1.
• A collision is called inelastic if the mechanical energy is not conserved. This
corresponds to 0 ≤ r < 1.
• A collision is called perfectly inelastic the two objects have the same velocity
after the collision. This corresponds to r = 0.
If you bounce a ball on the floor, we can relate the coefficient of restitution to how high
the ball bounces back up. If we drop the ball from a height h0 , the velocity of the ball
is given by v2
0 = 2gh0 before the collision, and v2
1 = r2v2
0 = 2gh0 after the collision.
The maximum height the ball reaches is found from 2gh1 = v2
1 = r2v2
0 = r2 2gh0 ,
which gives h1 = r2h0 as illustrated in Fig. 12.11.
The coefficient of restitution for a collision between two objects is defined as:
r = − v A,1 − v B,1
v A,0 − v B,0
. (12.62)
(Notice that the definition does not change if we exchange A with B, which is
necessary for such a definition to make sense.)
It is possible to show that r = 0 corresponds to the maximum loss of energy while
conserving momentum.

ball bouncing on the floor
v1 = -v0 v1 = -r v0 v1 = 0
12.5 Collisions 373
What does r depend on? Since any conservative force would lead to energy con-
servation and therefore r = 1, the coefficient of restitution characterizes the non-
conservative parts of the contact forces. In reality, there are many processes during a
collision that result in changes in kinetic energy, such as internal oscillations in the
objects, permanent deformations, and viscous- and frictional forces. For a given force
model, such as for a spring model with a viscous damping term, we can calculate the
velocity after a collision and therefore determine the coefficient of restitution.
Elastic Collisions
For an elastic collision between the two blocks A and B in Fig. 12.10, both the total
momentum and the mechanical energy are conserved:
m A v A,0 + m B v B,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 , (12.63)
1
2 m A v2
A,0 + 1
2 m B v2
B,0 = 1
2 m A v2
A,1 + 1
2 m B v2
B,1 . (12.64)
Since we are free to choose the coordinate system, we simplify the problem by
choosing a system where block B is initially at rest: v B,0 = 0, giving:
m A v A,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 , (12.65)
m A v2
A,0 = m A v2
A,1 + m B v2
B,1 . (12.66)
These two equations have a unique solution (see Extra material for a derivation).
v A,1 = m A − m B
m A + m B
v A,0 , v B,1 = 2m A
m A + m B
v A,0 . (12.67)
These formulas are general. Let us get to know them by studying a few special cases:
Equal Masses
If the two blocks have the same masses: m A = m B , we find that:
v A,1 = m A − m B
m A + m B
= 0 , v B,1 = 2m A
m A + m B
v A,0 = v A,0 . (12.68)

The two blocks exchange velocities! Before the collision block B is at rest and block
A is moving with velocity v A,0 , and after the collision block A is at rest, and block
B is moving with velocity v A,0 (see Fig. 12.12).
You are probably familiar with this effect. You notice it when two equally sized
balls collide head on, such as two billiard balls.
Collision with a Large Mass
What happens if block A collides with a large, stationary mass? That is, if m B m A.
We expect this to be like a collision with a stationary wall. We find:
v A,1 = m A − m B
m A + m B
v A,0 = (m A/m B ) − 1
(m A/m B ) + 1 v A,0 −v A,0 , (12.69)
where we have used the m A/m B  1, that is m A/m B 0 when m B m A.
Similarly, for v B,1 :
v B,1 = 2m A
m A + m B
v A,0 0 , (12.70)
For an elastic collision with a wall (or a very large object), the velocity is simply
reversed (see Fig. 12.12).
Collision with Small Mass
What happens if block A collides with a tiny block B? That is, if m A m B ? We
find that:
v A,1 = m A − m B
m A + m B
v A,0 = 1 − (m B /m A)
1 + (m B /m A) v A,0 v A,0 , (12.71)
12.5 Collisions 375
and
v B,1 = 2m A
m A + m B
v A,0 = 2
1 + (m B /m A) v A,0 2v A,0 . (12.72)
If a large object collides head on into a much smaller, stationary object, the large
object continues with approximately the same velocity, but the small object is shot
forward with twice the velocity of the large object (see Fig. 12.12).
Collisions and Relative Motion
So far we have only addressed the case when block B starts at rest, but our solutions
are more general than you may believe: We can use a coordinate system change to
map any collision onto the solutions we have found. Let us demonstrate how to do
this by addressing an elastic collision between a ball (object A) with mass m A and a
moving wall, the much more massive object B: m B m A.
The situation is illustrated in Fig. 12.13. Before the collision the velocity of the
ball is v A,0 and the velocity of the wall is v B,0 measured relative to a coordinate
system S, which we call the laboratory system. However, if we follow the motion of
the wall, in the system S′, the wall has velocity zero before the collision: v′
B,0 = 0.
How are the two coordinate systems related? In Sect. 6.4 who found that the
position r measured in system S is related to the position r′ measured in system S′
through:
r = R + r′ , (12.73)
Fig. 12.13 Illustration of a
collision between a ball (a)
and a wall (b). The collision
is addressed in both the
system S, where the wall has
a velocity toward A, and in
system S′, which follows the

where R is the position of system S′ measured in system S. We take the time derivative
on both sides to find a relation between the velocities:
v = u + v′ , (12.74)
where u is the velocity of system S′ measured in system S. We apply this to the
current situation, where system S′ is moving with the (initial) velocity of the wall
u = v B,0 , we get:
v′A,0 = v A,0 − u = v A,0 − v B,0 , (12.75)
and
v′
B,0 = v B,0 − u = v B,0 − v B,0 = 0 , (12.76)
which was the whole point—since v′
B,0 = 0 we can use the solution from (12.69) to
determine the velocity after the collision in the S′ system:
v′A,1 = −v′A,0 = − (v A,0 − v B,0
) . (12.77)
We find the velocity in the original system by the reverse transformation:
v A,1 = v′A,1 + u = v′A,1 + v B,0 = −v′A,0 + v B,0
= − (v A,0 − v B,0
) + v B,0 = 2v B,0 − v A,0 , (12.78)
This is what happens when a ball hits a wall that moves toward the ball, such as a col-
lision between a golf club (massive) and a golf ball (small mass). Similar techniques
can be used to address other solutions.
General Solutions to Elastic Collisions
We can find the general solution for an elastic collision between blocks A and B as
illustrated in Fig. 12.10:
v A,1 = (m A − m B ) v A,0 + 2m B v B,0
m A + m B
(12.79)
v B,1 = (m B − m A) v B,0 + 2m A v A,0
m A + m B
. (12.80)
(A proof of this result is given in Sect. A.2).
12.5 Collisions 377
Perfectly Inelastic Collisions
For a perfectly inelastic collision the two blocks A and B become attached after the
collision, and they continue with the same velocity, v1 :
v A,1 = v B,1 = v1 , (12.81)
In this case, only the total momentum is conserved, and not the kinetic energy.
Conservation of momentum gives:
m A v A,0 + m B v B,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 , (12.82)
Velocity After Perfectly Inelastic Collision
In the case when v B,0 = 0, we find:
m A v A,0 = m A v1 + m B v1 = (m A + m B ) v1 , (12.83)
which gives:
v1 = m A
m A + m B
v A,0 = v A,1 = v B,1 . (12.84)
Loss of Energy After Perfectly Inelastic Collision
The mechanical energy is not conserved for a perfectly inelastic collision. This means
that the initial kinetic energy of the system is transformed into thermal energy and
has been used to deform the objects permanently. The perfectly inelastic collision
gives the maximum loss of energy. Let us find the change in kinetic energy in the
collision.
Before the collision (when B is at rest), the kinetic energy is:

12.5.1 Example: Ballistic Pendulum
Problem: A 10 g bullet is fired into a 1 kg wooden block hanging in a 1 m long rope.
The block reaches a height 30 cm above its initial level. (a) What was the velocity of
the bullet? (b) What was the loss of energy in the system?
Identify: In this problem we address the motion of two objects: The bullet (object
A) and the block (object B). The block is hanging from a massless rope. This means
that the block behaves as a pendulum after the collision between the bullet and the
pendulum. After the collision, the block swings to a height h above its initial position.
The process is illustrated in Fig. 12.14.
Model: In this problem, we do not know the detailed interactions between the bullet
and the block. Therefore, we use conservation laws to address the collision between
the bullet and the block. The bullet becomes stuck in the block—this means that the
bullet and the block has the same velocity after the collision—the collision is perfectly
inelastic. Before the collision the bullet has a horizontal velocity, vA,0 = v0 i, and
the block is at rest, vB,0 = 0. After the collision, both objects have the velocity
vA,1 = vB,1 = v1 i.
Solution to part a: There are no external forces acting on the system in the x-
direction during the collision. (There may be forces acting on the system in the
y-direction—depending on the motion of the system and the effect of the rope. We

assume that during the collision, the rope is vertical, so that the rope does not exert
a horizontal force on the system.) From Newton’s second law in the x-direction we
get: ∑ Fx = 0 = d
dt
( p A,x + p B,x
) . (12.89)
The total momentum in the x-direction is therefore conserved during the collision:
m A v A,0 + m B v B,0
︸︷︷︸
=0
= m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 ⇒ v1 = m A
m A + m B
v A,0 . (12.90)
In the second part of the process, the block and bullet swings up as a pendulum.
In this process, the rope does not do any work on the system, and we assume that
the air resistance is negligible. The only force doing work on the system is therefore
gravity. In this second part of the process, the mechanical energy is conserved!
Notice that in this case the process consists of two separate subprocesses. In the
first subprocess, the collision, the mechanical energy is not conserved, but in the
second subprocess, the swinging pendulum, the mechanical energy is conserved.
We use energy considerations to determine how high the pendulum swings. The
mechanical energy at the beginning of this motion, immediately after the collision,
is the same as the mechanical energy when the pendulum has reached its maximum
height. At its maximum height the kinetic energy of the pendulum is zero. Conser-
vation of mechanical energy therefore gives:
1
2 (m A + m B ) v2
1 = (m A + m B ) gh ⇒ h = v2

2g =
( m A
m A + m B
)2 v2

2g . (12.91)
Now, the problem posed was to find the initial velocity, v0 , as a function of h. We
find v0 from (12.91):
v0 = √2gh
( m A + m B
m A
)
. (12.92)
Let us now insert the numbers given in the problem:
v0 =
√
2 (9.8 m/s 2) (0.3 m)
( 1.01 kg
0.01 kg
)
245 m/s . (12.93)
Solution to part b: In the second part of the problem, we are asked to find the loss
of energy. The kinetic energy before the collision is
K0 = 1
2 m A v2
0 , (12.94)
380 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
and after the collision the kinetic energy is:
K1 = 1
2 (m A + m B ) v2

2 (m A + m B )
( m A

(12.95)

2 m A v2

m A
m A + m B

m A

. (12.96)
The relative loss of kinetic energy is therefore:
ΔK
K0
= m A
m A + m B
− 1 = − m B
m A + m B
, (12.97)
which means that practically all the energy was lost in the collision!
12.5.2 Example: Super-Ball
Problem: In super-ball we take two balls, one small and one large, and release them
together from a height h0 above the ground, as illustrated in Fig. 12.15. What is
the maximum height h1 reached by the top ball after the collision? Assume that all
collisions are conservative.
Identify: In this problem we address the motion of two objects: The bottom ball, A,
and the top ball, B. The whole process may be subdivided into three separate parts.
In the first part both objects are falling until they hit the ground. In the second part
they are colliding with the ground and each other, and in the third part, they are both
moving upward. The various subprocesses are illustrated in Fig. 12.15.
Model: We do not know the interactions between the balls, or between the balls and
the ground, but we know that all collisions are elastic. We will also consider the
problem to consist of a sequence of collisions between two objects: First the bottom

12.5 Collisions 381
ball collides with the ground, and then the bottom ball collides with the top ball. Let
us look at each of these subprocesses individually:
In the first part, the balls fall from a height h0 . We use energy conservation to find
the velocity:
K0 + mgh0 = K1 + mg0 , (12.98)
mgh0 = 1
2 mv2
0 , (12.99)
and
v0 = √2gh0 , (12.100)
is the velocity of both the balls.
In the second part, the bottom ball hits the floor. This is an elastic collision, where
we know tthat the velocity is reversed. After the collision, the bottom ball therefore
has an upward velocity v0 .
In the third part, the bottom ball collides with the top ball. Since the only external
force is gravity, which has a small impulse compared to the forces between the balls,
the net vertical force is approximately zero, and conservation of momentum in the
y-direction gives:
m A v A,0 + m B v B,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 , (12.101)
m A v0 + m B (−v0) = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 . (12.102)
Conservation of kinetic energy gives:
1
2 m A v2
A,0 + 1
2 m B v2
B,0 = 1
2 m A v2
A,1 + 1
2 m B v2
B,1 , (12.103)
where we insert v A,0 = v0 and v B,0 = −v0 :

2 m A v2
0 + 1
2 m B v2
0 = 1
2 m A v2
A,1 + 1
2 m B v2
B,1 . (12.104)
We can rewrite the two equations to be:
m A
(v0 − v A,1
) = m B
(v0 + v B,1
) , (12.105)
and
m A
(
v2

)
= m B
(
v2
B,1 − v2

)
, (12.106)
382 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
This last equation can also be written as:
m A
(v0 − v A,1
) (v0 + v A,1
) = m B
(v B,1 − v0
) (v B,1 + v0
) . (12.107)
Dividing the two equations, we get:
v0 + v A,1 = v B,1 − v0 ⇒ 2v0 = v B,1 − v A,1 . (12.108)
We eliminate v A,1 , finding:
v B,1 = 3m A − m B
m A + m B
v0 . (12.109)
Discussion: Let us address three special cases:
• For m A = m B
3 we find v B,1 = 0
• For m A = m B we find v B,1 = v0
• For m A = 3m B we find v B,1 = 2v0
• For m A m B we find v B,1 = 3v0
We find maximum height from the case when m A m B , using conservation of
energy for the motion of ball B:
m B gh B,2 = 1
2 m B v2
B,1 = 1
2 m B 9v2
0 , (12.110)
and therefore we find that:
h B,2 = 9h0 , (12.111)
which is the maximum height, in the case when the large ball has much larger mass
than the small ball.
Non-central Elastic Collisions
So far we have only studied one dimensional collisions—collisions where all the
objects move along a line so that all velocities also are directed along the line. Such
collisions are called central collisions:
In a central collision the momentum of both objects is directed along the line
between the two objects before and after the collision.

Let us now address the more general case where two objects are colliding, but
where the momentum of at least one of the objects is not directed along the line
connecting the centers of the objects (before the collision). An example of such a
collision is illustrated in Fig. 12.16.
We study this collision in a reference system where object B is initially at rest,
vB,0 = 0. Since there are no external forces acting on the system during the collision,
the total momentum is conserved:
m AvA,0 + m B vB,0
︸︷︷︸
=0
= m AvA,1 + m B vB,1 . (12.112)
If the collision is also elastic, the kinetic energy is conserved:
1
2 m A v2
A,0 = 1
2 m A v2
A,1 + 1
2 m B v2
B,1 . (12.113)
For this very general case we cannot make any further general statements. But for
a collision between two objects with equal masses, m A = m B , we find that the
conservation of momentum is:
vA,0 = vA,1 + vB,1 , (12.114)
384 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
and conservation of kinetic energy is now:
v2
A,0 = v2
A,1 + v2
B,1 . (12.115)
We insert vA,0 into (12.115):
v2
A,0 = v2
A,1 + v2
B,1
(vA,1 + vB,1
)2 = v2
A,1 + v2

v2
A,1 + 2vA,1 · vB,1 + v2
B,1 = v2
A,1 + v2
B,1
2vA,1 · vB,1 = 0 ,
We have found that vA,1 · vB,1 = 0, which means that the two velocities are orthog-
onal! Notice that we still do not have enough equations to determine the vectors:
We have 3 equations, but 4 unknown components in the velocity vectors after the
collision. In order to determine the velocities after the collision we need more in-
formation about the collision. We need to know something about the force acting
between the particles throughout the collision.
12.6 Modeling and Visualization of Collisions
We can gain better insights into the concepts introduced in this chapter by studying
collisions in detail. If we know the details of the interactions between two objecst,
that is, if the have models for the interaction forces, we can find their motion from
Newton’s second law.Let us use this to get a better understanding of elastic, inelastic
and perfectly inelastic collisions.
We model two objects, A and B, with masses m A and m B . The force from B on
A is:
FB on A = F(rA, rB , vA, vB ) , (12.117)
and from Newton’s third law, we know that
FA on B = −F . (12.118)
For example, for two solid spheres of radius R, a reasonable force model is:
F =
{ k |Δr − 2R| Δr
Δr − η (Δv) , Δr < 2R
0 , Δr ≥ 2R , (12.119)

. (12.120)
We find the motion of both objects from Euler-Cromer’s method, as implemented
in the following program. First, we define the masses, the radius, and the initial
positions and velocities of the objects:
from pylab import *
R = 0.02 # m
mA = 0.1 # kg
mB = 0.1 # kg
rA0 = array([0.0,0.0]) # m
vA0 = array([1.0,0.0]) # m/s
rB0 = array([0.08,0.018]) # m
vB0 = array([0.0,0.0]) # m/s
time = 0.10 # s
This set of initial conditions are illustrated in Fig. 12.17. These conditions will result
in an non-central collision. Then, we define the parameters used by the force model,
such as the force constant k and the viscous term η. We choose an unrealistically
small value for k in order to make the collision extend over some time so that we can
observe the interactions during the collision. The time step is chosen small enough,
so that we are sure to have good resolution for the motion during the collision:
# Force model
eta = 1.0
k = 20000.0 # Nm
dt = 0.0001 # s
We initialize by generating arrays for all the variables:
# Initialization
n = int(round(time/dt))
t = zeros(n,float)
rA = zeros((n,2),float)
vA = zeros((n,2),float)
rB = zeros((n,2),float)
vB = zeros((n,2),float)
386 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
F = zeros((n,2),float)
rA[0] = rA0
vA[0] = vA0
rB[0] = rB0
vB[0] = vB0
D = 2*R # Diameter
Where we have introduce the diameter, D = 2R, to simplify the expressions. The
integration loop follows the mathematical formulation of the force law in (12.119)
as closely as possible:
# Integration loop
for i in range(n-1):
Deltar = rB[i]-rA[i]
Deltarnorm = sqrt(dot(Deltar,Deltar))
Deltav = vB[i]-vA[i]
if (Deltarnorm>=D):
Fnet = array([0,0])
else:
Fnet = -k*abs(Deltarnorm-D)**1.5*Deltar/Deltarnorm + eta*Deltav;
F[i] = Fnet
aA = Fnet/mA
aB = -Fnet/mB
vA[i+1] = vA[i] + aA*dt
rA[i+1] = rA[i] + vA[i+1]*dt
vB[i+1] = vB[i] + aB*dt
rB[i+1] = rB[i] + vB[i+1]*dt
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
Finally, we plot the resulting trajectories and the momentum in the x and y direction
as functions of time:
# Plot trajectories and momentum
figure(1)
plot(rA[:,0],rA[:,1],’-b’,rB[:,0],rB[:,1],’-r’)
xlabel(’x [m]’)
ylabel(’y [m]’)
axis(’equal’)

plot(t,pA[:,1],’-b’,t,pB[:,1],’-r’);
xlabel(’t [s]’)
ylabel(’p_y [kgm/s]’);
While these plots provide useful information about the collision, and we can use
them to gain intuition about collisions, we may also learn from seeing the dynamics
of the collision—how the objects move. This can be done by generating a simple
animation using the plot command:
# Animate using plot

for i in range(0,n,50):
plot(rA[:,0],rA[:,1],’-b’,rB[:,0],rB[:,1],’-r’,

xlabel(’x [m]’)
ylabel(’y [m]’)
axis(’equal’)
12.6 Modeling and Visualization of Collisions 387
However, you get a better impression from an animation that shows the extent of the
colliding spheres. In addition, we need to scale the coordinate system so that we have
room for not only the centers of the spheres, but also their whole extend, so that the
plotting region does not move around during the animation, since this will make the
animation difficult to interpret. We therefore find the maximum range of the objects
positions and scale the axes accordingly:
# Animate by drawing
figure(4)
xmin = min(min(rA[:,0]-R),min(rB[:,0]-R))
xmax = max(max(rA[:,0]+R),max(rB[:,0]+R))
ymin = min(min(rA[:,1]-R),min(rB[:,1]-R))
ymax = max(max(rA[:,1]+R),max(rB[:,1]+R))
theta = linspace(0,2*pi,100)
xcirc = R*cos(theta)
ycirc = R*sin(theta)
for i in range(0,n,50):
plot(rA[:,0],rA[:,1],’-b’,rB[:,0],rB[:,1],’-r’,
[rA[i,0]],[rA[i,1]],’ob’,[rB[i,0]],[rB[i,1]],’or’)

x = rA[i,0] + xcirc
y = rA[i,1] + ycirc

y = rB[i,1] + ycirc
plot(x,y,’-r’)
hold(’off’)

This program serves as the basis for the illustrations shown in this chapter and
Fig. 12.18. You can now use this code to study various collision—central elastic
collisions, non-central elastic collision, and inelastic collisions by introducing a finite
value for η. Reasonable values for η are in the range 1 kg/s < η < 10 kg/s.
Test your understanding: Based on this modeling framework, you are now ready to model other
interactions. For example, you may introduce an ionic inteaction for the force between two ions: F =
−C Δr−2 (Δr/Δr). Try to implement and test this model using a similar approach as introduced
here.
12.7 Rocket Equation
A rocket accelerates forward by ejecting exhaust backward at high velocity. The
rocket is essentially throwing out mass backward in order to move forward. How can
we address the motion of a rocket using Newton’s second law?
We start from a specific example: A rain drop is falling down through the at-
mosphere and on the way it adsorbs water vapor that condensates on the drop. Let
us address the motion of the drop over a small time interval from t to t + Δt. During
this time interval the drop adsorbs a small drop of mass Δm and initial velocity u.
At the time t the mass of the drop is m and its velocity v. At the time t + Δt, the
mass is m + Δm and the velocity has changed to v + Δv.

The change in momentum of the drop is related to the external forces acting on
the drop. What is the change in momentum? At the time t, the total momentum (of
the drop and the small drop being adsorbed) is:
p(t) = mv + Δmu (12.121)
after the time interval Δt, the small drop is adsorbed, and the new momentum is:
p(t + Δt) = (m + Δm) (v + Δv) = mv + mΔv + Δmv + ΔmΔv . (12.122)
The change in momentum is therefore:
Δp = p(t + Δt) − p(t) = mΔv + (v − u) Δm + ΔmΔv . (12.123)
Newton’s second law for the system related the change in momentum to the net
forces acting on the system:
∑ Fext = Δp
Δt = m Δv
Δt + (v − u) Δm
Δt + Δm Δv
Δt . (12.124)
12.7 Rocket Equation 389
This is only valid in the limit when Δt → 0. If we assume the adsorption process
also to be continuous, the change in mass and the change in velocity also goes to
zero when Δt goes to zero. Hence, the term:
Δm Δv
Δt → 0 when Δt → 0 . (12.125)
In the limit of small Δt we therefore find the Rocket equation:
Rocket equation:
∑ Fext = dp
dt = m dv
dt + (v − u) dm
dt . (12.126)
The rocket equation is used to describe the motion of an object that is expelling or
adsorbing mass with a velocity u. A special case is when the expelled or adsorbed
mass has zero velocity, u = 0:
∑ Fext = dp
dt = m dv
dt + v dm
dt (12.127)
which is what we get when taking the derivative of p = mv with a time-dependent
mass.
For a rocket, we may not generally know at what speed relative to the ground
the exhaust is ejected, but rather at what speed relative to the rocket the mass is
expunged. We introduce the velocity of Δm relative to m as:
vrel = u − v , (12.128)
using this notation we can write the rocket equation (12.126) as:
Rocket equation: ∑ Fext + vrel
dm
dt = m dv
dt . (12.129)
Written in this form, the equation looks like the usual formulation of Newton’s second
law, and we interpret all the terms on the left side as forces, and the term on the right
side is the mass multiplied by the acceleration. Expelling mass with a velocity vrel
relative to the object at a rate dm/dt, has the same effect as pushing on the object
with a force:
F = vrel
dm
dt . (12.130)

12.7.1 Example: Adding Mass to a Railway Car
Problem: A railway car is moving with constant velocity along a straight railway
track. While it is moving, sand is dropped onto the car from above at a constant rate,
R = dm/dt, as illustrated in Fig. 12.19. With how large force, F, must the car be
pulled in order for the car to move with constant velocity?
Solution: We use the rocket equation to relate the forces acting on the car to its
acceleration. The only horizontal force acting on the car is the external force F,
friction and air resistance. We assume that friction and air resistance forces are
negligible. The sand is falling onto the car from above. This means that the sand has
a vertical velocity but no horizontal velocity as it hits the car. We can therefore use
the rocket equation, with u = 0:
∑ Fext = (v − u) dm
dt + m dv
dt , (12.131)
The net horizontal force on the car is F = F i, and the velocity is constant, dv x /dt =
0, and the velocity u x = 0 therefore:
F = (v x − u x ) dm
dt + m dv
dt = (v x − 0) dm
dt + m × 0 = v dm
dt . (12.132)
The force is therefore given by the velocity and the rate at which mass is added.
12.7.2 Example: Rocket with Diminishing Mass
Problem: A rocket is at rest in outer space, where the net force acting on the rocket
is zero. In order to accelerate, it turns on its thrusters, which propels exhausting
gases backward with a velocity vrel relative to the spaceship. Find how the velocity
increases as the fuel is used.
12.7 Rocket Equation 391
Solution: Let us describe the motion with the x-axis directed forward—in the direc-
tion of motion of the rocket. The rocket starts with the velocity v0 = 0. We use the
rocket equation to find an expression for the velocity of the rocket:
∑ Fext + vrel
dm
dt = m dv
dt , (12.133)
Here, the net external force is zero, and all motion is in the x-direction:
− vrel
dm
dt = m dv
dt ⇒ dv
dt = −vrel
1
m
dm
dt . (12.134)
We find the velocity by integrating from t0 to t1 :
∫ t1
t0

dt dt = −vrel
∫ t1
t0
1
m
dm
dt dt = −vrel
∫ m(t1)
m(t0)
dm
m , (12.135)
which gives
v(t1) − v(t0) = −vrel (ln m(t1) − ln m(t0)) = −vrel ln m(t1)
m(t0) . (12.136)
This is the increase in velocity of the rocket as the mass changes from m(t1) to m(t0).
We notice that the velocity is increasing, since the final mass, m(t1) is always smaller
than the initial mass m(t0).
Summary
Translational momentum: is defined as p = mv
Newton’s second law: on general form is: ∑ Fext = dp/dt
Impulse: Change in momentum is related to the impulse, J, of the net force:
J =

Fextdt = p(t1) − p(t0) .
The average net force: during a collision is:

System of particles: For a system of particles we distinguish between:
392 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
• internal forces acting between particles in the system, and
• external forces acting between particles in the system and objects in the environ-
ment.
Newton’s second law for a system of particles: is
d
dt
∑
j
p j = ∑ Fext
Isolated system: A system is isolated if the net external force is zero.
Conservaton of momentum: For an isolated system, the total momentum is con-
served, ∑
j p j = constant. Conservation of momentum is a vector equation, which
can be applied for each direction independently of other directions.
Collisions: For a collision between two objects A and B, the total momentum is
conserved if there are no external forces: pA,0 + pB,0 = pA,1 + pB,1 .
Elastic collisions: In an elastic collision, the kinetic energy is conserved.
Elastic collision in one dimension: The velocities of the objects after the collision
are:
v A,1 = (m A − m B ) v A,0 + 2m B v B,0
m A + m B
, v B,1 = (m B − m A) v B,0 + 2m A v A,0
m A + m B
Perfectly inelastic collision: is a collision where the two objects have the same
velocity after the collision: vA,1 = vB,1
Perfectly inelastic collision in one dimension: The velocity after the collision is:
v1 = v A,1 = v B,1 = m A v A + m B v B
m A + m B
,
Inelastic collision: is a collision with energy loss, characterized by the coefficient of
restitution, r = − (v B,1 − v A,1
) / (v B,0 − v A,0
)
Rocket equation: The motion of object that in a small time Δt is absorbing a mass
Δm with a velocity u, is given by the rocket equation:
∑ Fext = m dv
dt + (v − u) dm
dt
If the velocity of the absorbed/ejected material is vrel relative to the object, the rocket
equation can be written:
∑ Fext + vrel

dt = m dv
dt .

the starting velocity of the golf ball?
12.2 Energetic collision. Can a collision between two objects result in zero total

12.3 A collision paradox. A riddle: Two cars each with speed v0 collide head
on, getting stuck in the collision. If you observe the collision from the side of the
road, the change in total kinetic energy is ΔK = 2 · (1/2)mv2
0 . If you instead
observe the collision from a system moving with one of the cars, one car has velocity
0 and the other car has velocity 2v0 . Then the change in total kinetic energy is
(1/2)m(2v2
0) = 4 · (1/2)mv2
0 , which is double of what you observed from the side
of the road. Is this argument correct? Explain.

angle θ with the wall surface. When the ball leaves the wall after the collision, the
magnitude of the velocity is the same, but its direction has changed. However, only
the component of the velocity that is normal to the wall changes during the collision.

Projects
12.14 Newton’s cradle. In this project you will learn about collisions and conser-
vations laws by studying the behavior of Newton’s cradle. Newton’s cradle is a toy
consisting of a series of steel balls each suspended by two strings so that the balls
form a horizontal line when the cradle is at rest. The balls are initially barely touch-
ing each other. You can play with the toy by lifting and releasing a ball on one side.
When the moving ball hits the stationary balls, a single ball is ejected on the other
side, and the other balls remain stationary.
First, we study a cradle consiting of two balls of identical masses m hanging in
thin strings as illustrated in Fig. 12.20. The left ball is lifted to a vertical height h0
and released. The left ball hits the right ball when the string points directly down.
(a) Find the velocity v0 of the left ball immediately before it hits the right ball.
(b) Assume the collision between the balls is elastic. Find the velocities v A

of the two balls after the collision. How does your result compare with the behavior
of Newton’s cradle described above?
(c) What is the maximum height, h1 , of the right ball?
(d) Assume the collision is perfectly inelastic. Find the maximum height h1 reached
by the right ball after the collision.
Assume the collision is characterized by a coefficient of restitution, r. The relative
velocity after the collision is then related to the relative velocity before the colision
by v B
1 − v A
1 = rv0 .
(e) Find the velocities of each of the balls after the collision.
We will in the following study a system with three balls, A, B, and C. We will
assume that all forces are conservative, so that all collisions are elastic. Initially,
immediately before the collision, ball A has a positive velocity v0 and the other balls
are not moving.
396 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions
(f) Let us assume that the balls are seperated by small distances, so that there are
two collisions, first between ball A and B and then between B and C. What are the
velocities of the balls after the first collision? And after the second?
Let us now assume that all the balls are initially in contact, so that we cannot
assume that there are two seperate, subsequent collision. This is the configuration
corresponding to Newton’s cradle.
(g) Find equations relating the initial and final velocities of all three balls. Can you
solve these equations?
In order to understand what happens in Newton’s cradle when all the balls are
initially in contact, we will develop a simple, numerical model of the process. In the
numerical model we will only address the collision itself, and we will assume that
the motion of all the balls is one-dimensional along the x-axis during the collision.
We introduce an explicit model for the forces between the balls, and use this to
calculate the motion of all the balls throughout the collision using Newton’s second
law for each of the balls.
The position of the balls are given as x i , i = 0, 1, 2. At the beginning of the
collision, at t = 0, all the balls are just in contact, so that the distance between them
is equal to their diameters, d, x i = i d.
The force on ball i from ball i + 1 is modelled using a simple, position-dependent
force on the form
Fi,i+1 =
{ −k |x i+1 − x i − d|q when x i+1 − x i < d
0 when x i+1 − x i ≥ d . (12.137)
The following program solves the equations of motion from a time t = 0 to a
time t = t1 . You must choose the mass, m, the constant k, and initial conditions for
the simulation yourself.

t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
for j in range(N):
plot(t,v[:,j]), hold(’on’)
print ’v/v0 = ’,v[n-1,:]/v0
(h) Test the program and your parameters by direct comparison with your results
above for N = 2, where N is the number of balls. Your answer to this and the
following questions should include plots of the velocities. Hint: You must ensure
that the timestep dt is chosen reasonably compared to the values of k and m.
(i) Use the program to determine the result of a collision when N = 3. What are
the velocities of the balls immediately after the collision? Is this result physically
reasonable? Does this correspond to the behavior you expect for Newton’s cradle?
(j) Modify the force law by changing k and q. Can you find parameters that produce a
behavior close to what you observe in Newton’s cradle, that is, for which the velocity
of the middle ball is close to zero after the collision?
(k) Can you now explain why only one ball is ejected from the left side when one
ball is released from the right side in the toy cradles you can buy?
12.15 Catching an atom. In this project we will study a collision between two
identical atoms of mass m that both are affected by forces from a massive particle
such as a molecule.
First, we study the behavior of a single atom affected by a force from the molecule.
The potential energy for the interaction between the atom and the molecule is:
U (x) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
∞ when x < b − d
1
2 k (x − b)2 when b − d < x < b + d
U0 when x > b + d
, (12.138)
where b and d are lengths and d < b,
U0 = 1
2 kd2 , (12.139)
and x is the position of the atom. We assume that the molecule is stationary at the
point x = 0. (The atom cannot enter the region where the potential is infinite. You
may instead assume that the energy is very large, U1 U0 , if you find this easier to
discuss).
(a) Sketch the potential. Draw in an example of the motion of the atom when the
total energy is less than U0 , and a motion where the total energy is larger than U0 ,
and describe the motions briefly.
(b) Find the force F(x) on the atom as a function of x.
We will now study a collision between an atom (B) of mass m which start from
rest at the point x B = b, and an identical atom (A) which starts at x A > b + d with

an initial velocity −v A,0 . For each of the atoms, the interaction with the molecule
can be described by the potential energy U (x), so that the potential energy for atom
A is U (x A) and the potential energy for atom B is U (x B ). There are no long-range
interactions between the atoms. They only interact when they are in the same point,
x A = x B . In that case they collide. After the collision they become attached to
each other. You can assume that the atoms have not moved significantly during the
collision.
(c) Find the velocity of atom A in the point x A = b immediately before the collision.
(d) Find the velocities of atom A and atom B immediately after the collision.
(e) How large must v A,0 be in order for atom B (and atom A) to detach itself from
the molecule after the collision? (An atom is detached if it can move infinitely far
away from the molecule).
We will now study the same process, but in two dimensions. The massive molecule
is now at rest at the origin, and the potential energy of an atom has the same form as
above, but is now a function of the distance r = √x2 + y2 to the origin (Fig. 12.21):

r when
b − d < r < b + d.
(g) The atom starts with velocity v0 in the position r0 at the time t0 = 0. Write a
program to find the position of the atom as a function of time. Plot the trajectory of
the atom.
(h) We use the program to simulate the motion of the atom when r0 = (b, 0) and
v0 = (0, v0). The result is shown in the figure below. Explain the results. How would
you measure the period of this motion in your program?
12.7 Rocket Equation 399
(i) You want the atom to follow a circular orbit around the molecule with a constant
speed v. How do you have to choose the initial conditions to obtain such an orbit?
Can you get a circular orbit for all speeds v? Explain your answer.
(j) How would you need to modify your program to model the motion of atom A
before and after the collision. (After the collision atom A and atom B moves as one
point particle).
(k) Atom A starts with velocity v0 in the position r0 at the time t = t0 and collides
with atom B at the time t1 . Is it possible to get atom B (and atom A) to detach from
the molecule afte the collision?
(l) How do you have to choose v0 and r0 to make atom B follow a circular orbit after
the collision.

Multiparticle Systems
So far we have studied the motion of objects, but we have not been very precise
in defining an object. What we really have studied is the motion of mass-points,
particles, or extended objects that move as a particle. What does it mean to move
as a particle? It means that all the points in the object move with the same velocity
and the same acceleration, the whole object is translated as a stiff (rigid) body: The
various parts of the object are not moving relative to each other.
But this does not seem to be a good description of everyday phenomena around us.
If you are running, you are surely not moving both your arms and your legs with the
same velocity and acceleration all the time. And if you throw a ball, it may wobble
and spin on its path. Even on the microscopic level objects are not only translated:
Molecules may vibrate, spin, or wobble as they move. When the world is so complex,
can we still use the simple descriptions and models we have developed so far, or do
we have to describe the motion of each small part of the object independently?
Fortunately, we are saved by Newton’s third law: If we only define the position
of the object in a particular way, by defining the position of the object as its center
of mass, Newton’s second law is valid for any system of particles, and therefore for
any object. This wonderful consequence of Newton’s second and third laws allows
us to use the force models and the concepts we have developed so far also to address
extended objects. The motion of an object is further simplified if the object is a rigid
body: An object where the relative positions of any two points do not change, that
is, the object is only translated and rotated, but does not change shape, stretch, or
otherwise deform during its motion.
In this chapter, we discuss the motion of systems of particles—multiparticle sys-
tems. Before we proceed to describe the motion of rigid bodies in Chaps. 15 and 16,
we first introduce a general description of rotational motion in Chap. 14.
13.1 Motion of a Multiparticle System
Let us start describing a system of many particles. For most practical purposes,
two particles are many particles, but we are ambitious and start with a system of
N particles. We number the particles using the index j running from 1 to N as

illustrated in Fig. 13.1. The position of each particle is given in a coordinate system
S as illustrated. The position of particle 1 as a function of time is r1(t), and its mass
is m1 . Similarly, the position of particle j is r j and its mass is m j .
All the quantities we have defined so far are easily extended to each of these
particles. For example, the velocity and acceleration of particle j is found from the
derivatives of the position vector:
v j = dr j
dt , a j = dv j
dt , (13.1)
and the momentum of particle j is p j = m j v j .
The motion of each particle is determined from the forces acting on it. In our
discussion of momentum, we already discussed that the forces acting on particle j
may be either from one of the other particles in the system, or from the environment.
Forces from other particles in the system are called internal forces, and forces from
the environment are called external forces. Newton’s second law for particle i is
therefore:
Fnet
i = Fext
i + ∑
j =i
F j,i = d
dt pi , (13.2)
where F j,i is the force from particle j on particle i.
In order to find the motion of one of the particles inside the system, we need to
know both the external forces acting on this particle and the forces from the other
particles in a system. This may require a complicated force model, for example,
consider the forces acting between two parts of a tennis ball as the ball wiggles
and rotates. Often, we are not interested in the detailed motion of particles inside
a system, but only in the motion of the system as a whole. We can address this by
adding together (13.2) for each particle i, getting:

13.1 Motion of a Multiparticle System 403
As we noticed when we discussed the total momentum of a system of particles, the
sum of all the internal forces will always contain both the force F j,i and the force
Fi, j . Since these two forces are action-reaction pairs, they are equal, but oppositely
directed. Therefore, every such pair will cancel. The sum of all the internal forces is
therefore zero!
If we introduce P = ∑
i pi as the total momentum of the system, we find:
∑
i
Fext
i = d
dt P , (13.4)
This looks a lot like Newton’s second law, but now for the system of particles. We
can make this similarity even stronger by introducing the velocity V of the system
so that:
P = MV = ∑
i
pi = ∑
i
m i vi , (13.5)
where M = ∑
i m i is the total mass of the system.
Notice that this is a definition of the velocity V of the system. We define it this
way to be able to write the total momentum, P, of the system in the intuitive way
P = MV. From (13.5) we find:
V =
∑
i m i vi
∑
i m i
= 1
M
∑
i
m i vi . (13.6)
What is the acceleration of the system? It is natural to define the acceleration, A, of
the system as the time derivative of the velocity V of the system:
A = d
dt V = 1
M
∑
i
m i ai . (13.7)
Similarly, we define the position of the system, R, as:
Center of mass: The effective position of the system, or the center of mass of
the system, is defined as
R = 1
M
∑
i
m i ri , (13.8)
404 13 Multiparticle Systems
The velocity and acceleration of the center of mass are defined in the usual way:
V = dR
dt , A = d2R
dt2 . (13.9)
With these definitions:
Newton’s second law for a system of particles: is system as:
∑
i
Fext
i = d
dt P = MA . (13.10)
where M = ∑
i m i and P = ∑ pi .
(where we have assumed that the masses of the particles are constant).
This law, Newton’s second law for a system of particles, is what we have been
looking for. Equation (13.10) shows that if we define the position of the system in this
particular way, we can use Newton’s law exactly as we are used to, just remembering
that we are not describing the motion of each particle separately, but instead we
describe the motion of the effective position R of the system.
This law is powerful and surprisingly beautiful. It is the theoretical justification
for why we do not have to care too much about whether we describe the motion of
an object as a point or as a system of particles. We can describe the motion of any
system of particles as a point: The center of mass R of the system.
In the next sections we build our intuition about the center of mass R of a system
and we learn to apply Newton’s second law for a system of particles.
13.2 The Center of Mass
Why do we call the effective position R the center of mass? Let us start by address
this in a two-particle system. The effective position, R, of the two-particle system is:
R = 1
M (m1r1 + m2r2) . (13.11)
If the two masses are identical, we see that:
R = m1r1 + m2r2
m1 + m2
= mr1 + mr2
m + m = 1
2 (r1 + r2) , (13.12)
which is the midpoint between the two points.

We get a similar result for the N -particle system: When all the masses are the
same, the effective position R is:
R = 1
N
∑
i
ri , (13.13)
as illustrated in Fig. 13.1. This is simply the arithmetic mean of the position vectors.
As long as all the masses are the same, the center of mass is what we typically
would call the geometric center of the points. What happens when the masses are
not equal? In this case, we weigh in the masses in the average, so that the center
of mass is the mass-weighed average of the positions of the particles-which is the
natural definition of the center of mass of an object.
Notice that the center of mass R is a vector. We can therefore calculate the center
of mass for each component, along each axis, independently of the other axes.
The Subdivision Principle
If we combine two systems A and B, where we know the center of mass for each
these systems, how can we find the center of mass for the whole system?
The situation is illustrated in Fig. 13.2. Each of the systems could be a rigid body,
or just a collection of point masses. System A has total mass M A and a center of
mass at RA, and system B has a total mass M B and center of mass at RB .
Let us enumerate all the particles using the index i. The first k particles are in
system A, and the last N − k particles are in system B. What is the center of mass,
R, of the whole system with mass M = M A + M B ?
The definition of R is:
MR = ∑
i
m i ri =
k∑
i=1
m i ri +
N∑
i=k+1
m i ri = M ARA + M B RB , (13.14)
and therefore:
R = M ARA + M B RB
M A + M B
. (13.15)
We can therefore find the center of mass of a system of two objects A and B, by
assuming that object A and B are point masses with the whole mass of each object
406 13 Multiparticle Systems
located in the center of mass of each object. This means that if we want to find the
center of mass of two solid bodies, we can find the center of mass of each object,
and then find the center of mass of the combined object by assuming each object to
be a point mass.
Solid Bodies
So far we have only defined the center of mass of a system of a finite number of
particles. How can we find the center of mass of a solid body?
The definition of the center of mass for a continuous object follows directly from
the definition for a system of many particles. We divide the solid body into small
volumes ΔVi = Δx i Δyi Δz i at the position ri . The center of mass is:
R = 1
M
∑
i
m i ri , (13.16)
where the mass of the volume element ΔVi depends on the local mass density, ρ(ri ).
When the size of the volumes goes to zero, the sum approaches the integral of the
mass density of the volume, V , of the solid body:
R = 1
M
∫ ∫ ∫
V
r ρ(r) d V . (13.17)
In physics, we often write this as an integral over the mass elements dm instead:
R = 1
M
∫
M
r dm . (13.18)
In order to calculate the integral, we calculate the values for each of the components
separately:
M X =
∫ ∫ ∫
V
x ρ(x, y, z) dx dy dz , (13.19)
and similarly for the Y and Z components.

13.2.2 Example: Center of Mass of Object with Hole
Problem: Find the center of mass of a homogeneous disk with radius R, with a
circular hole of radius r touching the outer edge of the disk, as illustrated in Fig. 13.4.
Solution: This examples demonstrates that the subdivision principle also can be used
in reverse to remove a part of an object, such as a circular hole in a circular disk. We

start from a homogeneous disk, object AB, and remove a smaller circular portion,
object B, and is left with a disk with a hole, object A.
The mass of the complete disk is M AB = π R2ρ, where ρ is the mass (area)
density, and the mass of the small disk is M B = πr2ρ. The subdivision principle
states that the center of mass of the whole disk (object AB), which is at the origin,
R = 0, can be written as:
M AB R︸︷︷︸
=0
= M ARA + M B RB . (13.24)
We solve this equation to find RA, the unknown center of mass for object A.
RA = − M B
M A
RB = − πr2ρ
π R2ρ (R − r) i = − r2
R2 (R − r) i , (13.25)
Notice the simplicity of this approach. We did not have to perform any integration.
This use of symmetries is a characteristic of physics that you will meet many times
during your career.
13.2.3 Example: Center of Mass by Integration
Problem: Find the center of mass of a thin, homogeneous triangular plate with sides
of length a and b, as illustrated in Fig. 13.5. (You must be able to solve double-
integrals to understand this example).
Solution: The center of mass for a continous, homogeneous object is defined as:
MR =
∫

where we have written the integral over the mass. Instead, we may integrate over
space and use the mass (area) density, ρ:

13.2 The Center of Mass 409
We need to find both the mass, M, and the position R. Both are found by integration
over the area A, which is the area of the triangle. First, we find the mass by inte-
grating over the area A. We integrate x from 0 to a, and y from 0 and up to the line
corresponding to the upper boundary of the triangle. This is a line going through the
points x = 0, y = b and x = a, y = 0. The straight line through these points has
the equation y = b(1 − x/a).

(13.28)
which, of course, is the well know formula for the area of a triangle multiplied with
the mass density ρ of the triangle.
Now, we find the position of the center of mass by calculating the integral for MR
for each component:
M X =

(13.29)
The center of mass in the x-direction is therefore:
X = M X
M = ρ (1/6) a2b
ρ (1/2) ab = 1
3 a . (13.30)
We use the same method in the y-direction:

(13.31)
which gives
Y = MY
M = ρ (1/6) b2a
ρ (1/2) ab = 1

The center of mass is therefore:
R = 1

13.2.4 Example: Center of Mass from Image Analysis
The center of mass is often used to describe the center of an object in an image . It
may be because we are taking pictures of an object we want to track, such as the
wandering behavior of a small grain of dust dancing through the air or the motion
of a asteroid seen on the sky, or it may be to determine the center of mass of an
irregularly shaped object.
How can we find the center of mass from an image? First, we need to read the
image so that we can access it. The image is taken from a classroom experiment,
where we have extracted a smaller part of the image for analysis (see Fig. 7.4). We
read the image ballimage02.png using:
Let us immediately display it to see if we got the right image:
subplot(1,2,1);
imshow(z)
axis(’equal’)
show()
where the axis commands are to clean up the plotted image. Notice that Python
uses position [0,0] for the upper left part of the image, and that the first coordinate
is the vertical coordinate and the second coordinate is the horizontal coordinate, so
that [iy,ix] is position [ix,iy] in the image. We call each (x, y) position for
a pixel . We find the size of the image using size:
>> shape(z2)
(411,559)
The image is stored as the matrix z(y, x, j) which contain values of red (R, j = 1),
green (G, j = 2), and blue (B, j = 3) . However, we cannot use these color values
directly to find the center of mass. Instead, we need to know if a pixel at (x, y) is a
part of the object or not. We therefore set a threshold on the image, so that all pixels
that are brighter than this threshold is included (set to value 1), and all the rest of the
pixels are set to zero (Fig. 13.6):
z2 = (z[:,:,0]+z[:,:,1]+z[:,:,2])>1.5
subplot(1,2,2)
imshow(z2)
axis(’equal’)
The resulting images as shown in Fig. 13.7. The left image is the original image and
the left image shows the filtered image, where all the pixels that are part of the ball
are colored red.
Now, we are ready to find the center of mass:
X = 1
M
∑
i
x i , Y = 1

∑

These formulas can be directly converted into an algorithm: For each pixel i, if the
pixel is a part of the object, that is if z(x i , yi ) = 1, we include the positions x i and
yi in the sum for the center of mass and include the pixel in the sum for the mass.

412 13 Multiparticle Systems
This method is used for motion tracking of an image. If we are able to automatically
filter the image so that we only get the object of interest, we can use this method to
find the center of mass of the object for each frame in a movie and thereby find the
center of mass as a function of time. Usually this requires careful positioning of the
camera and a good choice of background for the filming.
13.3 Newton’s Second Law for Particle Systems
We have found that if we measure the position of a system of particles using the
center of mass, R, of the system, the system behaves according to Newton’s second
law:
∑ Fext = MA , (13.35)
where A is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system of particles, and the
sum is over all external forces. This is true for any system of particles, from a galaxy
consiting of starts, to the solar system, to a rigid body consiting of a large number
of invididual atoms, down to a molecule or even an atom: The acceleration of the
center of mass is given by the external forces acting on the system.
It is this law that allows us to use the techniques we have developed so far on any
system, a solid body or a system of particles. In the previous chapters we have strictly
speaking only discussed the motion of point-particles with a mass. We have always
assumed that every part of a solid body has been moving with the same velocity. We
have not allowed the object to oscillate, vibrate, change shape, or rotate. We have not
allowed it to do any of the things that real objects do. However, we have now been
saved by Newton’s second law for particle systems: If we measure the position of
an object as the center of mass of the object, we can still use Newton’s second law
to find its motion, even if the object is vibrating, oscillating, rotating, or displaying
other types of internal motion.
If I throw a ball through the room, we have previously found that the motion of
the ball can be found from Newton’s second law for the ball:
∑ F = G = −mg j = ma . (13.36)
The beauty of Newton’s second law for particle systems is that we can use exactly
the same analysis for a spinning or oscillating ball. The motion of the center of mass
of the ball only depends on the external forces acting on the ball:
∑ F = G = −mg j = mA . (13.37)
It does not matter what happens internally in the ball—if it is deformed, spinning,
or vibrating—the motion of the center of the mass is the same as for a point particle
as long as the external forces acting are the same.
13.3 Newton’s Second Law for Particle Systems 413
However, you might argue that the external forces acting on a spinning ball are
different because of air resistance: It is the interaction with the air that causes a
spinning ball to move sideways, which is called curving the ball. This is a valid
objection. The motion of the center of mass is determined by the external forces
acting on the object. But, if we can neglect the effects of air resistance, the motion
of the center of mass of a rod when you throw it is the same when it is rotating as
when it is not rotating. This may be surprising, but it is a result of Newton’s second
law for particle systems.
13.3.1 Example: Ballistic Motion with an Explosion
Problem: A projectile is fired from the ground. Its initial velocity in the horizontal
direction is v0 . When it reaches its maximum height of h, a charge is set off, splitting
the projectile into two equal parts. One part moves forward with the velocity v1 . Find
the trajectory of each of the parts, and the trajectory of their center of mass. You may
neglect air resistance.
Solution: We have illustrated the process in Fig. 13.8. The process has three stages.
In stage one, the projectile moves to its maximum height only under the influence of
gravity. In the second stage, the explosion takes place, after which the projectile is
split into two projectiles. In the third stage, each part propagates to the ground only
affected by gravity.

Fig. 13.8 A projectile explodes at the top of its path, splitting into two equal pieces. We track the
position of each part until they hit the ground
414 13 Multiparticle Systems
Model: First, let us address the explosion. During the explosion, each part of the
projectile is subject to large forces. But the only external force acting on the parts is
gravity. Consequently, there is no external horizontal force acting on the system. The
horizontal momentum is therefore conserved at all times. In particular, the momen-
tum is the same immediately before and immediately after the explosion. We use
conservation of momentum to determine the horizontal velocities of the parts after
the explosion.
Before the explosion, the horisontal momentum of the system is:
p0 = mv0 , (13.38)
and after the collision, the horizontal momentum is:
p1 = m A v A + m B v B = m
2 v A + m
2 v B . (13.39)
Conservation of momentum gives:
v0 = 1
2 v A + 1
2 v B , (13.40)
where v B = v1 is the velocity of part B after the explosion, and v A is the velocity of
part A, which we need to find:
v A = 2v0 − v B = 2v0 − v1 . (13.41)
We therefore know the initial conditions for the motion in the third stage. Each part
is affected by gravity alone: GA = −m A g j, GB = −m B g j.
Finding the motion of part B: First, we find the motion of part B. Newton’s second
law in the x-direction gives:
∑ Fx = 0 = m B a B . (13.42)
The velocity in the x-direction is constant. The position is therefore:
x B (t) = x B (t0) + v B t = v0t , (13.43)
where we have placed the origin at the ground directly below the explosion. Therefore
x B (t0) = 0.
The motion in the y-direction corresponds to the motion of a falling object, hence:
y B (t) = h − 1
2 gt2 . (13.44)
13.3 Newton’s Second Law for Particle Systems 415
Finding the motion of part A: Similarly, we find the position of part A:
x A(t) = v A t = (2v0 − v1) t , y A(t) = h − 1
2 gt2 . (13.45)
We notice that the motion in the y-direction is the same for the two parts, which is
as expected. The two parts will therefore strike the ground at the same time.
Finding the motion of the center of mass: We use these results to find the center
of mass:
R =
∑
i m i ri
∑
i m i
. (13.46)
We find the x- and y-components independently:
X =
∑
i m i x i
∑
i m i
=
m
2 x A + m
2 x B
m
2 + m
2
= 1
2 (x A + x B ) = 1
2 ((2v0 − v1) t + v1t) = v0t .
(13.47)
This is what we get if we apply Newton’s second law for a particle system. There are
no external horizontal forces acting on the system, therefore the horizontal component
of the center of mass moves with constant velocity:
∑ Fext = −mg j = mA ⇒ A x = 0 ⇒ X = v0t . (13.48)
We see that Newton’s second law for particle systems gives the same result as when
Newton’s second law is applied to each object.
Similarly, we find the y-position of the center of mass:
Y =
∑
i m i yi
∑
i m i
=
m
2 y A + m
2 y B
m
2 + m

2
(
h − 1
2 gt2 + h − 1
2 gt2
)

2 gt2 , (13.50)
We could also have found this directly from Newton’s second law for particle systems:
∑ Fext = mA = −mg j ⇒ A y = −g ⇒ Y (t) = Y (t0) − 1
2 gt2 = h − 1
2 gt2 .
(13.51)
Analyze: We have demonstrated that we can find the motion of the center of mass
either by calculating the motion of each of the parts of the system, or we can find the
motion of the center of mass by applying Newton’s second law for particle systems
directly. The results are of course the same. However, there are many questions
416 13 Multiparticle Systems
we only can answer if we know the motion of each part. For example, in order to
determine how far apart the two parts are when they hit the ground, we need to find
the motion of each of the parts.
13.4 Motion in the Center of Mass System
Newton’s law for multiparticle systems gives us the tool to determine the motion of
the center of mass of a complex object based on the external forces acting on the
system. The law is surprisingly robust. If you throw a rod through the air, and you
neglect the effects of air resistance, the motion of the center of mass of the rod does
not depend on how the rod is moving relative to its center of mass: The motion of the
center of the mass is the same if the rod is moving as a ridig body without rotating,
as in Fig. 13.9a; if the rod is rotating around its center of mass, as in Fig. 13.9b; or if
the rod is rotating and wobbling. The motion of the center of mass of the rod does
not depend on internal forces in the rod. Therefore, the motions of individual parts
relative to the center of mass do not affect the motion of the center of mass.
However, in many cases we are interested in both the motion of the center of
mass and of the motion of the individual parts relative to the center of mass. For
example, we may be interested in the rotation of the rod, or its wobbling, or in how
it is vibrating. Then it is useful to split the motion of the system into the motion of
the center of mass and the motion of a particle relative to the center of mass.

Laboratory and Center of Mass Systems
We have already discussed how we always measure the motion of a system relative
to some reference system. For example, we may characterize the motion of the
rod relative to a point on the ground. We call this system the laboratory system.
In addition, we introduce a coordinate system located in the center of mass of the
system of particles, as illustrated in Fig. 13.10. This system is called the center of
mass system.
The position of a particle i is ri in the laboratory system, and the position of
the center of mass of the system is R in the laboratory system. The position of
particle i in the center of mass system is rcm,i :
ri = R + rcm,i , (13.52)

of mass system.
Total Momentum in the Center of Mass System
What is the total momentum, Pcm , of the system in the center of mass system? The
total momentum is defined as:
Pcm = ∑
i
m i vcm,i = ∑
i
m i
d
dt rcm,i = d
dt
∑
i
m i rcm,i

=MRcm=0
= 0 . (13.54)
The total momentum of the system in the center of mass system is always zero! This
result does not depend on the sum of external forces being zero. This is always true.
Idenpendently of what is done to the system, it only depends on the definition of the
center of mass.
13.5 Energy Partitioning
We can describe the motion of (the center of mass of) multiparticle systems using
the concepts we developed in our studies of Newton’s laws of point particles. What
about the concepts of mechanical energy we used to address the behavior of single
particles, can we still use energy concepts for multi-particle systems?
Kinetic Energy of a Multi-particle System
What is the kinetic energy of a system of particles? The total kinetic energy is the
sum of the kinetic energy of every particle in the system:
K =
N∑
i=1
1
2 m (vi )2 =
N∑
i=1
1
2 m
( dri

)2
. (13.55)
Now, we want to divide the motion into the motion of the center of mass (the motion
of the whole system), and the motion relative to the center of mass:
ri = R + rcm,i , (13.56)
13.5 Energy Partitioning 419
and similarly for the velocities:
vi = V + vcm,i . (13.57)
We use this to rewrite the total kinetic energy of the system, getting
K = 1
2 M (V)2 + 1
2
N∑
i=1
m i
(vcm,i
)2 . (13.58)
(You find a proof in Sect. 1.3). This shows that the total kinetic energy can be divided
into two terms: The kinetic energy for the motion of the center of mass, the external
kinetic energy.
Kcm = 1
2 MV2 , (13.59)
and the kinetic energy due to the motion of the particles relative to the center of mass,
which we call the internal kinetic energy:
KΔcm = 1
2
N∑
i=1
m i
(vcm,i
)2 . (13.60)
The total kinetic energy is therefore partitioned into a sum of the internal
(KΔcm ) and external (Kcm ) kinetic energies:
K = 1

Kcm

If the whole object is translated, as illustrated in Fig. 13.9a, there is no motion relative
to the center of mass. Then the total kinetic energy is simply the kinetic energy of
the center of mass. What we have done previously is therefore correct as long as we
assume that the object is translated!
But what if parts of the system are moving relative to the center of mass? Then we
must also include the internal kinetic energy: The energy related to the motion relative
to the center of mass. For example, if a diatomic molecule is vibrating, we must also
include the kinetic energy of the vibrating motion of the atoms. This means that for
a system of particles we have more degrees of freedom—there are many possible
ways that kinetic energy can be realized inside the system. Hence, the kinetic energy
420 13 Multiparticle Systems
of a system may be conserved, even though the kinetic energy of the center of mass
is not conserved.
This means that we need a simplified way to describe the internal motion, the
motion relative to the center of mass, of a particle system. For example, as we will
see later, for rigid bodies we do not allow vibrations or other deformations of the
object. The only motion possible relative to the center of mass is a rotation the whole
body. In this case, we need to introduce a kinetic energy term related to the rotation
of the body, and this is indeed one of the main focus areas when we discuss the
dynamics of rigid bodies.
Potential Energy of a Multi-particle System
For a multi-particle system, the kinetic energy is partitioned into the external and
internal kinetic energy. What about the potential energy of a multi-particle system?
First, we need to be more precise. The potential energy related to what force? The
rod in Fig. 13.9 has a potential energy due to the gravitational force, which is the sum
of the potential energy of every particle in the rod. But in addition, parts of the rod may
be compressed or stretched, and as a result the rod has an internal potential energy
just as a in a diatomic molecule. We therefore need to discern between external
potential energy, the potential energy of an external force, and internal potential
energy, the potential energy due to interactions within the system.
Potential Energy Due to External Forces
If a conservative external force acts on all the particles, we can describe the interaction
through a potential energy, Ui (ri ), of particle i at position ri due to the external force.
The total potential energy of the system due to the external force is then:
UTOT =
N∑
i=1
Ui (ri ) . (13.62)
If the force is constant, such as for gravity near the Earth’s surface, this expression
can be further simplified. In this case, the potential energy of particle i is:
Ui (ri ) = m i gyi , (13.63)
and the total potential energy is:
UTOT =
N∑
i=1
m i gyi = g
N∑
i=1
m i yi = MgY , (13.64)
13.5 Energy Partitioning 421
where Y is the Y -coordinate of the center of mass of the system. We can therefore use
the well-known formula, U = mgy, also for the potential energy of a multiparticle
system, we only need to use the center of mass position for y. Again, we find that
we can use the concepts developed for point particles also for particle systems.
Notice that this conclusion is only true for a constant force. For a force that
depends on the position of each small part of the multi-particle system, the total
potential energy cannot always be expressed as a function of the position of the
center of mass alone. We may have to calculate the full sum (or integral) in (13.62).
But if the external force is approximately constant over the multi-particle system we
may approximate the potential energy by a function that depends only on the center
of mass position.
In addition, a multi-particle system may have internal degrees of freedom and a
corresponding internal potential energy.
Potential Energy Due to Internal Forces
The net force acting on a particle i in a multi-particle system includes both external
and internal forces:
Fnet
i = Fext
i + ∑
j =i
F j,i , (13.65)
where Fext
i is the net external force acting on particle i, external here meaning that
it has its origin outside the system. The force F j,i from particle j on particle i is an
internal force.
If all forces, external and internal, acting on the system are conservative, we
can introduce a potential energy for every force. The total potential energy of the
system is the sum of all the potential energies for each of the forces. We divide the
total potential energy into the external potential energy, the potential energy due to
external forces, and the internal potential energy, the potential enegy due to internal
forces:
UTOT = Uext + Uint . (13.66)
The external potential energy was found in (13.62):
Uext = ∑
i
Ui (ri ) . (13.67)
The internal potential energy is a sum over all potential energies for all the interactions
in the system:
Uint = ∑
i< j
Ui, j
(ri , r j
) . (13.68)
422 13 Multiparticle Systems
Notice that we include a given interaction, a pair of particles i, j, only once in this
sum! Here, we will not develop a general theory for this, but instead illustrate the
principle by an example: The conservation of energy in a bouncing dumbbell as
discussed in Sect. 13.5.1.
Conservation of Energy in a Multi-particle System
If all the forces, both internal and external, acting on a particle system are conserv-
ative, the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved:
ETOT = KTOT + UTOT , (13.69)
where
KTOT = Kcm + KΔcm . (13.70)
and
UTOT = Uext + Uint , (13.71)
which gives:
ETOT = Kcm + Uext + KΔcm + Uint . (13.72)
Based on this result we realize that in order to apply the principle of energy con-
servation when solving problems in mechanics, we need to have expressions for the
two terms KΔcm and Uint for the system. Unfortunately, these terms are not always
simple. For example, if you kick a football, the football will both rotate and wobble
during its flight, as illustrated in Fig. 13.11. The kinetic and potential energy associ-
ated with the wobbling represent internal degrees of freedom, and we do not know
how to quantify these without a detailed model for the deformation of the football.
For a detailed study of the motion of the football, energy concepts are therefore of
limited value as means for calculation. However, the energy concepts are still useful
theoretical techniques that provides us with concepts and methods to discuss the
Fig. 13.11 A football in flight filmed using a high-speed camera: The football rotates and wobbles
as it moves
13.5 Energy Partitioning 423
motion. In many cases, energy consideration are also the theoretical starting point,
for example, for determining the deformation of the football.
For a particular type of object, what we call a rigid body, we assume that the
internal deformation and the energies associated with these are negligible, and that
the object moves a rigid body. In this case we neglect the internal potential energy
of the system, but we still need to develop expressions for the kinetic energy of a
rotating rigid body. We return to this in Chap. 15 after a discussion of rotation in
Chap. 14.
13.5.1 Example: Bouncing Dumbbell
In this example we will demonstrate the main princples of energy partitioning through
a simple model system.
In this example we will address a two-particle system, where the two particles
interact through a spring (see Fig. 13.12). This can be a model of a diatomic molecule
consisting of two identical atoms, or for an elastic body that deforms and vibrates.
Here, we simplify the problem by assuming that the that the particles move along
a line, so that the motion is one-dimensional. In the next example, we extend our
discussion to two-dimensional motion, opening for rotation in addition to vibrations.

Fig. 13.12 Illustration of the dumbbell. Two identical particles of mass m are connected by a spring
with equilibrium length b and spring constant k. The system is lifted to a height h above a flat floor
and released. When the bottom particle hits the floor its velocity is reversed, as we know happens
in an elastic collision with a wall
424 13 Multiparticle Systems
Identify and Sketch: We address a system of two particles, each with mass m,
connected with a spring of equilibrium length b and spring constant k. Particle A
starts on top and particle B starts on bottom, their positions are x A(t) and x B (t)
respectively. We place particle B at a height h0 above the floor: x B (t0) = h0 , and
particle A is a distance b above particle B:x A(t0) = x B (t0) + b. When a particle
hits the floor the collision is elastic, which means that the velocity of the particle is
reversed after the collision.
Model: We find the motion of each particle from the forces acting on it. Particle A
is affected by two forces: Gravity GA = −mg j and the spring force FA. The spring
force depends on the position of both particle A and B:
FA = −k (x A − x B − b) j , (13.73)
Similarly, the forces acting on particle B are GB = −mg j and FB :
FB = −FA = k (x A − x B − b) j . (13.74)
Is it sufficient to study the motion of the center of mass alone? No, since we do not
have models for the external forces acting on the system, and we do not know when
or where they are acting without finding the motion of the individual particles. The
center of mass of the system is at:
X = 1
M
∑
i
x i = 1
2m (mx A + mx B ) = 1
2 (x A + x B ) . (13.75)
Since the system collides with the wall when one of the particles hits the wall, and
not when the center of mass hits the wall (which it never will), we must find the
motion of each particle individually.
Newton’s second law: We apply Newton’s second law to each particle to find its
acceleration:
aA = − k
m A
(x A − x B − b) j , (13.76)
aB = k
m B
(x A − x B − b) j . (13.77)
where we also have to include a possible collision between particle B and the floor.
Numerical solution: We determine the motion of the particles numerically using
a Euler-Cromer method. We need to include all forces acting on each particle, and
we execute a collision step whenever particle B collides with the wall. When does a
collision occur? Since we are determining the positions only at discrete time intervals
Δt, we do not expect the position of particle B ever to be exacly at the wall. Instead,
the particle will be outside the wall at one time, t, and then inside the wall at a later
13.5 Energy Partitioning 425
time, t + Δt, and the only thing we know is that a collision occurred at some time
during the time interval from t to t + Δt. We could try to improve our estimate
of when the collision occurs, but here we will simply assume that the result of a
collision is to reverse the velocity at the first time step the particle is “inside” the
wall. The most important part of our collision algorithm is that is conserves energy,
and this is indeed achieved by this method. Because the particle is not moved during
the collision, the potential energy is conserved. And since only the direction of the
velocity is changed, the kinetic energy is conserved.

Visualization of motion: A visualization of the motion of the system for the first
two collisions is shown in Fig. 13.13. Here, we have illustrated the positions of the
two particles at a few selected times. Before the first collision, the two particles
move without relative motion. After the second collision, the relative motion is
significant. (Notice that we have drawn the particles as small blocks, but they should
be interpreted as point-particles.)
Motion of the center of mass: The dashed line in Fig. 13.13 shows the motion of the
center of mass. We know that the motion of the center of mass only depends on the
external forces acting on the system. During the collision with the floor, the system

center of mass (dashed line) and the path of each of the particles. We have drawn in a system of
two blocks and a spring to help your intuition
is affected by both gravity and the contact force, but between collisions, the system
is only affected by gravity. Consequently, we expect the center of mass to behave as
a single object of mass 2m falling under the effect of gravity. That is, we expect:
A = −g ⇒ X (t) = X0 + V0t − 1
2 gt2 , (13.78)
which is seen as the parabolically shaped motion of the center of mass in Fig. 13.13.
Even though the particles are oscillating back and forth, the center of mass does not
display any oscillations, but shows a smooth, parabolic shape (as a function of time).
Energy partitioning: We notice that after the second bounce, the center of mass
does not bounce up to its initial level even though the total energy in the system is
conserved. If our system was a rigid ball, and the collision with the floor was elastic
(and we neglected air resistance), we would expect the ball to bounce up to its initial
level. Why do we expect this? Because at the top of the path, when X is maximum,
the velocity is zero. For a rigid ball, this would also imply that the kinetic energy
is zero, and that the total mechanical energy is equal to the potential energy, which
only depends on the height. For the rigid ball, the height of each bounce must be
the same. But for the dumbbell system, there are also internal degrees of freedom.
The kinetic energy is not zero at the top of the path, even though the velocity of the
center of mass is zero, because the particles are still moving relative to the center of
mass. Similarly, the total potential energy is not only equal to the potential energy in
the external gravitational field, but also depends on the relative positions of the two
particles.
We can use the concept of energy partitioning to analyze the behavior. The total
kinetic energy consists of:
K = Kcm + KΔcm , (13.79)

The kinetic energies are plotted in Fig. 13.14. Notice that before the bottom particle
hits the floor, there is no relative motion, and the internal kinetic energy (KΔcm ) is
zero. Each of the particles moves with the same velocity and the center of mass. Imme-
diately after the collision, the internal kinetic energy increases discontinuously—it
jumps to a high level. What happened? After the collision, the velocity of the bot-
tom particle is reversed. This has two effects. First, the center of mass now has zero
velocity. But the magnitudes of the velocities of each of the particles are unchanged.
The result is that each of the particles suddenly has a velocity relative to the center
of mass equal to the velocity they have before the collision. As a result, there is a
jump in the internal kinetic energy.
Another interesting observation is the oscillation in the internal kinetic energy
due to the oscilliation of the particles around the center of mass.

The two potential energies are plotted in Fig. 13.15. The potential energy of the center
of mass only follows the center of mass movement, and the internal potential energy
is related to the energy stored in the spring as the spring is compressed. A fine analysis
of Figs. 13.14 and 13.15 shows that the internal kinetic and potential energies are
oscillating with opposite phases—as we expect—so that when the internal kinetic
energy is maximum, the potential energy is at its minimum and vice versa.
Discussion: From this example we learn that mechanical energy is conserved only
if we include all the forms it may take. The mechanical energy correspoding to the
kinetic and potential energy of the center of mass is generally not conserved. In
addition we must take into account the many possible internal modes of motion and
associated potential energies. However, if we simplify our system so that vibrational
modes are not present, such as for a rigid body that does not deform, is it then
sufficient only to use the kinetic and potential energy of the center of mass? No! We
have looked at a too simple system! Real, two- and three-dimensional systems can
be rotated without deforming. We must therefore also include the effect of rotations.
This is the subject of the next chapters.
13.6 Energy Principle for Multi-particle Systems 429
13.6 Energy Principle for Multi-particle Systems
There are several ways to view energy conservation. So far, we have mainly used
energy conservation as a tool to determine the velocity of an object as a function of
position. In this case, we include all external and internal conservative forces in the
total energy of the object:
ETOT = K cm + KΔcm + Uext + Uint , (13.83)
As a method for calculation this worked very well as long as we could ignore the inter-
nal potentials and motion relative to the center of mass. Fortunately, this reprensents
a whole class of problems, the motion of ridig bodies, where there are no internal
vibrations and no internal potential energies, although the object may rotate, as we
will see further on. This approach is therefore a useful approach from a practical
point of view.
However, there is a different view on energy conservation which is very useful
from a theoretical point of view, while not that useful for direct calculations. In
this view, we consider all conservative interactions to be internal interactions. This
is done by including all the interacting objects in the system. For example, if we
study the motion of a ball falling towards the Earth under gravity, we include both
the ball and the Earth in the system. The potential energy of the ball relative to the
Earth is then an internal potential energy in a multi-particle system. Similarly, we
would treat the solar system as a system consisting of all the objects in the solar
system. We could also take a similar approach on an atomic scale. Indeed, we could
consider any object to consist of a large set of atoms, and since all the atoms interact
through position-dependent forces, usually central forces, all the internal forces are
conservative and the total energy of the system should be conserved. Unless there
are other, external forces acting on the system.
Internal Energy
If all the internal forces are conservative, the only way we can change the total energy
of the system is by the work done by an external force. For a system of a book lying
on the floor, a system of the book and the Earth, we would increase the total energy
of the system if we lifted the book by an external force. External work leads to a
change in the total energy. We often call the total energy of such a system the internal
energy of the system. We write this as:
Wext = ΔE . (13.84)
The work done by external force is the change in internal energy, ΔE. This formu-
lation is call the first law of thermodynamics, and is considered a fundamental law
in physics.
430 13 Multiparticle Systems
How can we then interpret the work done by an internal force, such as the work
done by gravity in the system of the book and the Earth? In this case, the work done by
gravity is given as a change in the internal potential energy of the book-Earth system.
For example, if we release the book from a height h above the ground and the let it
fall, the book has gained a kinetic energy correspondingn to the change in potential
energy when book reaches the ground. This is not a change in the total energy. There
is no change in internal energy. But it is an energy transfer between different forms
of internal energy: It is an energy transfer from potential to kinetic energy inside the
system. Since we have assumed that all internal forces are conservative, all internal
processes can be considered as transfers of energy.
The Arrow of Time
Hmmm. What about internal forces that are not conservative? How can we treat such
processes in this view? If we take the atomic view: All our systems consists of atoms
and interatomic interactions are conservative, any system should therefore only have
conservative forces. Where does the non-conservative interactions come from? For
example, if I take the book and slide it along an inclined surface from its initial
height h, there will also be a frictional force, and friction is not a conservative force.
Is the total energy still conserved in the book-Earth system in this case? Yes! What
happens is that as the book slides, the potential energy of the book-Earth system is
transfered to kinetic energy of the book, as well as many internal kinetic and potential
energies: The atoms in the book and the floor starts vibrating. This corresponds to
an increase in the temperature of both book and Earth, which again corresponds
to an increase in the internal energy. Thus, the total energy is conserved, but it is
now hidden in different internal energies inside the system. So why do we then call
the friction force conservative? Because it is conservative on a microscopic level:
The total energy is conserved, but it is not conservative on a macroscopic level: The
friction force depends on the relative velocities of the moving objects.
This transfer of energy from macroscopic kinetic energy, the kinetic energy of a
sliding book, to microscopic kinetic and potential energies in the various vibrations
of the atoms, effectively introduces the arrow of time. If we release the book with an
initial velocity downward, it will slide down the slope and eventually come to rest. The
total internal energy of the system is conserved (if we ensure that it does not interact
with any external forces). It is then fully possible that the book instantaneously starts
to slide upwards, back to its original position. If by accident the atomic vibrations
every time pushed the book in the right direction, it could happen. None of the
individual processes would be against the laws of physics. Such a processes would
not change the total energy of the system. But it would be extremely unlikely. And
this is the reason why it is not happening. And it is the reason why we laugh when we
play movies backwards. You will learn more about this later, when you learn about
statistical physics.

Rotational Motion
How can we describe the rotational motion of the Earth and how can we calculate
the velocity of a point on the surface of the Earth due to its rotation?
We can move a rigid body about by moving it, through translation, and by rotating
it, through rotation. Up to now we have only discussed translational motion. In this
chapter we will introduce the tools to describe rotations.
14.1 Rotational State—Angle of Rotation
How can we describe the motion of the rod shown in Fig. 14.1? We would like to
seperate the translational and rotational motion of the rod. In this case, for a rod
thrown across the room, the rod rotates around its center of mass. We can therefore
use the center of mass, R(t), to describe the translational motion of the rod. This is a
good choice, since the motion of the center of mass is determined from the external
forces acting on the rod—we could therefore find the motion of the center of mass
by solving the equations of motion. If we study the motion of the rod relative to the
center of mass, we get the bottom-right part of Fig. 14.1. How can we describe the
rotational state of this system? By the angle θ it has rotated around the center of
mass!
Angle and Axis of Rotation
While a freely moving object (such as a rod thrown across the room) usually rotates
around its center of mass,1 objects can also rotate around other points. We could for
example nail the rod to the wall in any point along the rod, and the rod would be

motion.

Fig. 14.1 The motion of a rotating rod thrown through the air
forced to rotate around this attachment point. The rotational configuration of the rod
is often called the rotational state of the rod. In order to uniquely define the rotational
state of the rod we need to specify both the attachment point O and the angle θ the
rod forms with the horizontal. But if we only specify the point O, we do not really
know how the object rotates around this point. We need to specify the rotational
axis as well as a point on the axis. For rotations in the x y-plane, we say that the
rotational axis is normal to this plane, that is, along the z-axis. This description holds
for rotations in two dimensions. We describe the three-dimensional case in Sect. 14.6.
In two dimensions, the rotational configuration of an object is described by:
the angle θ; the point O it is rotating around; and the direction of the rotational
axis, k.
How do we describe the positive rotational direction? This is customarily determined
by the right hand rule. Figure 14.2 shows how the direction of the positive z-axis
is determined from the directions of the x- and y-axes. We can also use this rule
14.1 Rotational State—Angle of Rotation 439

backwards: Given the direction of an axis, such as the z-axis, we can find the positive
rotational direction by pointing the right thumb in the direction of the axis: the positive
rotational direction is then in the direction your remaining fingers are curling: from
the x- towards the y-axis. In this direction θ increases, in the opposite direction the
angle decreases.
A Point on a Rotating Object
Given the angle θ and the rotation axis (including both a point on the axis and the
positive direction along the axis), we can unqiuely determine the orientation of a
rotating object. But how do we find the position of a particular point on a rotating
object from this?
Figure 14.3 shows the motion of a point P on an object rotating around a fixed
axis. We describe the position of P using a coordinate system that rotates along with
the object. The rotating coordinate system has to unit vectors that rotate with the
object: the unit vector ˆu r , which is directed radially outwards from the rotation axis,
and an axis normal to the radial direction with unit vector ˆu n . A point on the rod can
be described in this coordinate system by:
p = pr ˆu r + p n ˆu n . (14.1)
When the object has rotated an angle θ both unit vectors have also rotated. The radial
unit vector now forms angle θ with the horizontal, and is given as:
ˆu r = cos θ i + sin θ j , (14.2)
as illustrated in Fig. 14.3. The normal vector, ˆu n , is obtained by rotating ˆu r 90◦ in
the positive direction:
ˆu n = − sin θ i + cos θ j . (14.3)

Fig. 14.3 Illustration of the unit vector ˆu P , and the position of the point P during rotation of a rod
around an axis through the origin
If the object is rotating around a fixed axis, this gives the position of any point on
the object. If the object is rotating around a moving axis, such as the rotating rod in
Fig. 14.1, we also need to add the position of the axis—here given as the position of
the center of mass:
p = R + pr ˆu r + p n ˆu n . (14.4)
The attentive reader may recognize the decomposition using the unit vector ˆu r and
ˆu n as polar-coordinates. This is indeed correct.
Rotational Motion
We can describe the rotational motion of the rod from Fig. 14.1 by a motion diagram
for the rod. We have illustrated one such diagram in the bottom-right part of Fig. 14.1,
where we show the position of the rod at various times, ti , taken at constant time
intervals Δt. This plot looks like a movie of the motion of the rod, where all the images
have been superimposed into one image. A better way to visualize the rotational
motion of the rod is to plot the time evolution of the angle, θ(t). Figure 14.4 shows
θ(t) for the rotational motion in Fig. 14.1.
Test your understanding: Can you sketch two other motion diagrams for a rod that is rotating in
the negative direction and for a rod that is rotating faster and faster in the positive direction. Sketch
the corresponding diagrams for θ(t).

Periodicity of the State θ(t)
The angle, θ, describes a unique configuration of the rod for values from 0 to 2π
(measured in radians). What happens when θ(t) increases beyond 2π? When θ
reaches 2π the rod has rotated a full revolution, and the rod is in the same position
as it was when θ was equal to 0. We cannot discern these positions: The position of
the rod when θ = 2π is exactly the same as when θ = 0. However, it is customary
to only use angles between 0 and 2π to describe the rotational position. This means
that if the angle is larger than 2π we subtract 2π from the angle. This is seen in
Fig. 14.4: When the angle θ(t) reaches 2π, it continues at θ = 0. Similarly, when
the angle decreases below 0, we add 2π to the angle, so that it continues at 2π. You
are, of course, free to choose to describe the motion using an angle θ that increases
also beyond 2π, but then you have to remember that the motion is periodic so that
higher values does not represent new positions.
14.2 Angular Velocity
During rotation, the angle θ(t) changes with time. How can we characterize how fast
the rod rotates? By the angular velocity, which is defined as the rate of the change of
the angle in analogy with the (translational) velocity, which is the rate of change of
the position. During the time interval from t to t + Δt, the angle changes from θ(t)
to θ(t + Δt). We define the average angular velocity over the time Δt as:
¯ω = θ(t + Δt) − θ(t)
Δt = Δθ
Δt , (14.5)
When the time interval becomes small, we find the instantaneous angular velocity
for the rotational motion, which we in the following call the angular velocity:
442 14 Rotational Motion
Angular velocity:
ω = lim
Δt→0
Δθ
Δt = dθ
dt = ˙θ . (14.6)
Figure 14.4 shows the angle, θ(t), and the angular velocity, ω(t) = dθ/dt for the
rotational motion in Fig. 14.1. Since the angular velocity is the time derivative of the
angle, we interpret the angular velocity as the slope of the θ(t) curve (just as we did
for the translational velocity). We see that the motions in Fig. 14.1 has a constant,
positive angular velocity.
Test your understanding: Can you sketch θ(t) and ω(t) for a rod that is rotating equally fast in
the opposite direction?
Velocity of a Point on a Rotating Body
As the rod rotates, every part of the rod moves in a circle around the rotation axis.
What is the velocity of a small part of the rotating rod, and how can we relate it to
the angular velocity? Let us address the motion of a small part, P, of the rotating
body directly. We have illustrated its motion during a small time interval Δt, in
Fig. 14.5. The distance from P to the rotation axis is R. The small part P moves
along a circular path around the rotation axis with R as the radius. During the small

14.2 Angular Velocity 443
time interval Δt, the rod has rotated an angle Δθ from the orientation θ(t) to the
new orientation θ(t + Δt) = θ(t) + Δθ. How far has P moved? It has moved the arc
length Δs = RΔθ along its circular path. The speed of the small part P is therefore:
v = Δs
Δt = R Δθ
Δt . (14.7)
If we let the time interval Δt become infinitesimally small, we find the speed of the
point P to be:
v = ds
dt = d
dt (R θ) = R dθ
dt = R ω . (14.8)
The speed of a point on the rod is therefore proportional to the angular velocity of the
rotation, but also proportional to the distance R to the rotational axis: Points further
away from the rotation axis rotate with higher speeds.
What is the direction of the velocity vector for P? Fig. 14.5 shows that when the
time interval Δt becomes smaller, the change in angle Δθ also becomes smaller,
and the direction of the displacement vector from P at time t to P at time t + Δt
approaches that of a tangent to the circle. Excatly the same result we found earlier
when we studied circular motion. The velocity vector is therefore parallel to the
tangent to a circle of radius R, and points in the direction of the tangential unit vector
ˆu T . The velocity of the point P is therefore:
v = R ω ˆu T . (14.9)
Motion with Constant Angular Velocity
If an object rotates with a constant angular velocity, we can find the speed of the point
P from the distance traveled during one complete revolution, s = 2π R, divided by
the time of one revolution, call the period T :
v = s
T = 2π R
T , (14.10)
where R is the distance from P to the rotation axis. We also know that the velocity
is v = Rω, therefore we find that:
v = 2π
T R = ωR ⇒ ω = 2π
T . (14.11)
The angular velocity is often also called the angular frequency.

14.3 Angular Acceleration
The rotation may occur at a constant angular velocity, as in Fig. 14.4, or the angular
velocity may vary. By analogy with translational motion, we characterize the rate of
change of the angular velocity by the the angular acceleration, α, defined as:
Angular acceleration:
α = dω
dt = d2θ
dt2 = ¨θ . (14.12)
14.3.1 Example: Oscillating Antenna
Problem: You are using an underwater antenna to measure the electromagnetic
response of the seafloor to search for hydrocarbons. The antenna has a length L = 5 m
and is suspended from its top point above the seafloor (see Fig. 14.6a). You cannot
use the antenna until the speed of its center is less than vc = 0.2 m/s. You have
attached a measurement device to the antenna that measures the angle θ the antanna
forms with the vertical as a function of time. You measure the behavior after you
have lowered it to the bottom, and the resulting data is in antennaangles.dat. 2 How
long time does it take before you can use the antanna?
2 http://folk.uio.no/malthe/mechbook/antennaangles.dat.
14.3 Angular Acceleration 445
Approach: We read the data, find the angular velocity as a function of time by a
numerical derivative, use this to find the speed of a point on the antenna, and find
when the speed is less than the threshold vc.
Solution: We read the file, getting a set of angles, θ(ti ), measured at discrete times, ti :
from pylab import *
t, theta = loadtxt(’antennaangles.dat’,usecols=[0,1],unpack=True)
plot(t,theta)
The resulting angles θ(ti ) are shown in Fig. 14.6b. The angular velocity is the
time derivative of the angle, but since we only know the angles for discrete times,
we must calculate the derivative numerically:
ω(ti )  θti+1 − θti
ti+1 − ti
, (14.13)
which is implemented as:
n = len(theta)
omega = zeros(n,float)
for i in range(n-1):
omega[i]=(theta[i+1)-theta[i])/(t[i+1]-t[i])
plot(t,omega)
The velocity of a point P at the middle of the rod can be found from v = ωR, where
R = L/2 is the distance from the rotation axis to the point P. We calculate and plot
the results:
R = 2.5
v = omega*R
plot(t,v)
From the figure we find that we need to wait for approximately t  25 s before we
can use the antenna.
14.4 Comparing Linear and Rotational Motion
We have now introduced the angle θ, the angular velocity ω, and the angular accel-
eration α used to describe the rotational motion of an object. Our definitions are
clearly similar to the definitions we used to introduce position, x, velocity v, and
acceleration a for linear motion, as illustrated in Table 14.1. Notice the analoguous
form of these equations: They are identical from a mathematical point of view. It
is only our physical interpretation, and therefore also the units, which are different.
The mathematical methods we use to determine motion are the same for linear and
rotational motion. You can therefore use all the techniques you have developed to
study linear motion also to address rotational motion.

14.5 Solving for the Rotational Motion
The structured problem-solving approach we developed for linear motion is also
applicable for rotational motion: We identify the quantities to be modeled; we model
the system, resulting in a set of differential equations; we solve the differential equa-
tions; and *analyze the results. We will see that for rotational motion, we usually
need to solve the equation of motion where the angular acceleration α is given:
d2θ
dt2 = dω
dt = α(t, θ, ω) , (14.14)
with initial conditions θ(t0) = θ0 and ω(t0) = ω0 . You should realize that this is
exactly the same equation we have solved over and over again for linear motion, only
with different symbols (and interpretations) for the variables. You can therefore use
the machinery you have developed and are comfortable with from linear kinematics.
You do not need to learn anything new!
Analytical Integration
For a given α(t) we know how to solve to determine the motion: We solve by direct
integration. The angular velocity is the time integral of the angular acceleration:
ω(t) − ω(t0) =
∫ ω
ω0
dω =
∫ t
t0
dω
dt dt =
∫ t
t0
α(t) dt . (14.15)
And the angle is the integral of the angular velocity:
θ(t) − θ(t0) =
∫ t
t0
ω(t) dt =
∫ t

ω(t0) +

)
dt . (14.16)
14.5 Solving for the Rotational Motion 447
For a constant angular acceleration α(t) = α0 we find
ω(t) − ω(t0) =
∫ t
t0
α0 dt = α0 (t − t0) , (14.17)
θ(t) − θ(t0) =
∫ t
t0
(ω(t0) + α0 (t − t0)) dt = ω(t0) (t − t0) + 1
2 α0 (t − t0)2 .
(14.18)
Analytical Solution
If the angular acceleration instead is a function of θ or ω, we cannot integrate, but
must instead solve the resulting differential equation. For example, if the angular
acceleration is α = −Cω, and ω(0) = ω0 , then we must solve the equation
dω
dt = α = −Cω , ω(0) = ω0 . (14.19)
We now recoqnize this equation immediately, knowing from experience that the
solution is just the same as we found for motion with air drag. The solution to this
equation is on the form ω(t) = A exp(−Ct), where A is determined from the initial
condition: ω(0) = A = ω0 .
Symbolic solution: If you do not remember how to solve this equation, you can
always use the symbolic solver in Python. Equation (14.19) is solved by
>> from sympy import *
>> omega = Function(’omega’)
>> t = symbols(’t’)
>> omega0 = symbols(’omega0’)
>> C = symbols(’C’)
>> dsolve(Derivative(omega(t),t)+C*omega(t),omega(t))
omega(t) == C1*exp(-C*t)
This is the same solution as we found above, we just need to determine the value of
C1 from the initial conditions.
Numerical Integration
These approaches work fine as long as we can solve the problems analytically. How-
ever, most problems of practical interest are not solveable, just like for linear motion.
However, we can use the same approach and the same numerical methods to solve
the equations of motion for the angular motion, as we have done for linear motion.
448 14 Rotational Motion
Euler-Cromer’s method for angular motion: Euler-Cromer’s method follows
exactly the same scheme as for linear motion:
ω(ti + Δt) = ω(ti ) + Δt α(ti ) (14.20)
θ(ti + Δt) = θ(ti ) + Δt ω(ti + Δt) , (14.21)
Motion of underwater antenna: We can demonstrate this method by determining
the motion for an angular acceleration on the form, α = −c1 sin θ − c2ω2 , with
initial conditions θ(0) = 10◦ and ω(0) = 0. (This is a reasonable model for the
motion of the antenna in Sect. 14.3.1. You will later learn how to find the parameters
for such models.). We solve this problem through the following implementation of
Euler-Cromer’s method:
g = 9.81, L = 5.0, D = 60.0 # Parameters
M = L*(0.10)**2*5.0*1e3
c1 = 1.5*g/L
c2 = 0.75*(D*L)/M
time = 60.0
dt = 0.0001
omega0 = 0.0
theta0 = 10.0*pi/180.0
n = int(time/dt); # Arrays
theta = zeros(n,float)
omega = zeros(n,float)
alpha = zeros(n,float);9
t = zeros(n,float)
theta[0] = theta0 # Initial conditions
omega[0] = omega0
for i in range(n-1): # Integration loop
alpha[i] = -c1*sin(theta[i])-c2*abs(omega[i])*omega[i]
omega[i+1] = omega[i] + alpha[i]*dt
theta[i+1] = theta[i] + omega[i+1]*dt
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
This simulation produces the motion seen in Fig. 14.6b.
14.5.1 Example: Revolutions of an Accelerating Disc
Problem: A DVD is accelerating at a constant rate of 2 rad/s2 starting from rest.
How many times have the disc rotated in 10 s?
Approach: We find the angle as a function of time, use this to find how far the disc
has rotated in 10 s, and finally find how many rotations this corresponds to.
Solve: We find the angle as a function of time by first integrating the angular accel-
eration to find the angular velocity, and then integrating the angular velocity to find
the angle. The disc rotates with a constant angular acceleration α starting at rest at
t0 = 0 s:
ω(t) − ω(0 s) =
∫ t
0
α dt = αt , (14.22)
14.5 Solving for the Rotational Motion 449
where ω(t0) = 0 s−1 since the disc starts at rest at t0 = 0 s. We find the angle θ by
integration:
θ(t) − θ(0 s) =
∫ t
0 s
ω(t) dt =
∫ t
0 s
(αt) dt = 1
2 αt2 . (14.23)
We insert α = 2 rad/s 2 to find the angle after 10 s:
θ(10 s) = 1
2 2 s−2 (10 s)2 = 1
2 2 × 100 = 100 . (14.24)
The angle θ is related to the number of rotations through θ = n2π, where the angle
2π corresponds to one rotation. We find the number of rotations after 10 s from:
n(10 s) = θ(10 s)
2π = 100
2π  15.9 . (14.25)
That is, the disc rotates 15.9 times in 10 s.
14.5.2 Example: Angular Velocities of Two Objects in Contact
Problem: Two gears with radius R A and R B are rotating and in contact as illustrated
in Fig. 14.7. The angular velocity of wheel A is ωA. Find the angular velocity of
wheel B. What is the relationship between the angular acceleration of wheels A and
B?
Solution: First, we notice from the figure that the angular velocities must have oppo-
site signs. Second, the condition that the two wheels are rotating without sliding
means that their speeds at the point of contact must be equal, but oppositely directed.
Fig. 14.7 Two gears with
radius R A and R B are

450 14 Rotational Motion
We call such a condition a kinematic condition. We will frequently use such condi-
tions when we solve problems in mechanics.
For each of the wheels, the velocity at the point of contact is related to the angular
velocity by:
v A = R AωA , v B = R B ωB . (14.26)
Since the velocities at the point of contact are equal and oppositely directed, we find
that the angular velocities also are related:
v A = −v B ⇒ ωB = − R A
R B
ωA . (14.27)
This relation is general and does not requires the velocities to be constant. We can
therefore find the angular accelerations by taking the time derivatives on each side:
αB = d
dt ωB = − d

ωA = − R A

14.6 Rotational Motion in Three Dimensions
You now know how to describe rotations in a plane: Rotations around the origin
in the x y-plane are described by the rotation angle θ, the angular velocity ω, and
the angular acceleration α. We found that a point, P, on the rotating object follows
a circular path with a constant distance R from the rotation axis as illustrated in
Fig. 14.8, and that the velocity of P is:
v = Rω , (14.29)
directed along the tangent to the circle. Can we find a simple expression for both
the direction and magnitude of the velocity? Yes! Since we know that the tangent

rotation around the z-axis.

is normal to the radius vector, r, and since it is in the x y-plane, the tangent is also
normal to the unit vector in the z-direction. This allows us to write the velocity vector
of the point P as:
v = ω k × r . (14.30)
This expression provides the correct magnitude and direction of the velocity vector: It
points in the positive rotational direction if ω is positive, and in the negative rotational
direction if ω is negative. We can therefore introduce the angular velocity as a vector:
ω = ω k (angular velocity vector) (14.31)
The angular velocity vector, ω, points along the axis of the rotation. For rotation in
the x y-plane, the rotation axis is the z-axis.
The expression in (14.30) is valid not only for rotation in the x y-plane, but for
any rotation around the axis given by the ω vector. This is illustrated in the right part
of Fig. 14.8, where the velocity of a point at r going in a circular orbit around the
rotation axis is given by the radius of the circle, ρ, and the angular velocity, ω:
vθ = ω ρ . (14.32)
We see from the geometry that the radius ρ is r sin(γ ), where γ is the angle between
the position vector, r and the angular velocity vector, ω. Therefore
vθ = ω r sin(γ ) . (14.33)
The direction of the velocity is tangential to the circular orbit: orthogonal to the
position vector, r, and to the angular velocity vector, ω. This means that we can write
the velocity as
v = ω × r , (14.34)
which gives both the correct magnitude: |v| = ωr sin(γ ), and the correct direction.
However, you can only use this expression when the origin of the position vector is
on the rotation axis.
Let us use (14.34) to find the acceleration of the point P, which moves in a circular
orbit with constant radius ρ = R sin(γ ) around the rotation axis given by the angular
velocity vector ω. The acceleration vector is the time derivative of the velocity vector:
a = dv
dt = d
dt ω × r = dω
dt × r + ω × dr
dt , (14.35)
but we know that:
dr
dt = v = ω × r , (14.36)
452 14 Rotational Motion
and we introduce the angular acceleration vector, α as:
α = dω
dt , (14.37)
which inserted back into (14.35) gives:
a = α × r + ω × (ω × r) . (14.38)
For a motion with constant angular velocity, that is with constant speed, the angular
acceleration vector is zero: α = 0, and the acceleration vector is:
a = ω × (ω × r) . (14.39)
This is the sentripetal acceleration on vector form.
• The direction of the vector is correct. If you use the right-hand rule to find the
vector product, you realize the vector points orthogonally inwards towards the
rotation axis.
• The magnitude of the acceleration is |a| = a = ω2ρ = (v/ρ)2 ρ = v2/ρ, which
is the magnitude of the sentripetal acceleration we found in (14.35).
14.6.1 Example: Velocity and Acceleration of a Conical
Pendulum
Problem: A conical pendulum consists of a mass in a string of length L. The mass
rotates with angular velocity ω in a circular orbit with radius R, as illustrated in
Fig. 14.9. Find the velocity and acceleration of the mass.
Solution: The vector velocity of the conical pendulum is given as v = ω × r. We
find the velocity when the pendulum crosses the x-axis. In this case, the position
vector is

14.6 Rotational Motion in Three Dimensions 453
r = R i +
√
L2 − R2 k . (14.40)
The rotation is about the z-axis. We therefore introduce the angular velocity vector
as ω = ω k.
We find the vector velocity:
v = ω × r = ω k ×
(
R i +
√
L2 − R2 k
)
= ωR (k × i) = ωR j . (14.41)
Similarly, we find the acceleration vector:
a = α × r + ω × (ω × r) = 0 + ω k × (ωR j) = −ω2 R i . (14.42)
The acceleration vector points in towards the axis of rotation, as expected.
Summary
Description of rotation:
• The rotation of an object is described by the angle θ(t)
• The angular velocity of the object is: ω(t) = dθ/dt
• The angular acceleration of the object is: α(t) = dω/dt = d2/dt2 .
Rotation and translation:
• A point on the rotating body at a distance R from the rotational axis has a tangential
velocity: v = R ω.
Solving rotational motion:
• We solve problems in rotations using the same structured approach as for linear
motion.
• In the “Solver” we solve the equation: d2θ/dt2 = α(t, θ, dθ/dt) with the initial
conditions θ(t0) = θ0 and ω(t0) = ω0 .
Numerical solution:
• Numerically, we solve the equation using an iterative approach starting from the
initial conditions. For example, we can use Euler-Cromer’s method:
ω(ti + Δt) = ω(ti ) + Δt α(θ(ti ), ω(ti ), ti )
θ(ti + Δt) = θ(ti ) + Δt ω(ti + Δt)
454 14 Rotational Motion
Analytical solution:
• When the angular acceleration, α = α(t), is only a function of time, t, we can
solve the equations by direct integration:
ω(t) = ω(t0) +
∫ t
t0
α(t) dt , θ(t) = θ(t0) +
∫ t
t0
ω(t) dt ,
A typical example is motion with constant angular acceleration.
• For motion with constant angular velocity the solution is:
θ(t) = θ(t0) + ω (t − t0) .
• For motion with constant angular acceleration the solution is:
ω(t) = ω(t0) + α (t − t0)
θ(t) = θ(t0) + ω(t0) (t − t0) + 1
2 α (t − t0)2 .
Rotational motion in three dimensions:
• Generally, rotations occur around an axis, given by the angular velocity vector, ω.
• The velocity of a point on the rotating object at position r is: v = ω × r
• The acceleration of a point on the rotating object at position r is: a = α × r + ω ×
(ω × r)

Chapter 15
Rotation of Rigid Bodies
We have found that the motion of the center of mass of a multi-particle system can
be determined from the external forces acting on the system. The general form of
Newton’s second law allows us to find the motion from our knowledge of forces
and force models for multi-particle systems, just as we have systematically done
for particle systems previously. We therefore have a well developed framework to
determine the motion of the center of mass.
But what about the internal motion of the system, the internal motion relative to
the center of mass? If you kick a football, it spins and wobbles on its path. How can
we determine the configuration of the football—how it is rotated and deformed at
a particular point along its path? Unfortunately, we generally cannot determine the
configuration without having a detailed model for the particle system. We need to
model the internal motion of the various parts of the football to address its deformation
and rotation. Even in the simplest multi-particle system we can think of, the diatomic
molecule, energy is partitioned in a non-trivial manner, including both kinetic and
potential energy contributions for the deformation of the molecule.
Fortunately, in many cases we can simplify the system significantly by assuming
that an object behaves as a rigid body that does not deform. A solid sphere, a stiff rod,
a ball with little deformation, or a molecule with little internal deformation, may in
many cases be approximated as a rigid body—as a body without any internal defor-
mation. This simplifies our description significantly: If the body does not deform,
there are no internal energies associated with the deformation either. A rigid body
can only be translated or rotated. In this chapter we will introduce the kinetic and
potential energy of a rigid body. We find that it depends on the rotational inertia of a
rigid body, called the moment of inertia. Rigid bodies with large moments of inertia
require more energy to spin than rigid bodies with smaller moments of inertia. This
gives us the tools we need to apply energy considerations to systems with rotating
parts.

458 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodies
15.1 Rigid Bodies
A rigid body is a solid body that is not deformed. What does this mean? It means
that:
The distance between any two points in a rigid body does not change.
What possibilities does that leave us with?
• We may translate the body. If we move all the points by the same amount, we
have not changed the distanced between any points.
• We may rotate the body, because any rotation does not deform the body—it only
changes its orientation in space.
A rigid body can have any shape, and it may also be a very simple object. For example,
an object consisting of two point masses at a fixed distance d is a rigid body, and a
reasonable model for a diatomic molecule if the internal deformation is negligible.
A rigid body is therefore a good approximation for a solid sphere, but not for a soap
bubble.
15.2 Kinetic Energy of a Rotating Rigid Body
For a rigid body, we can find a simplified expression for the kinetic energy. Previously
(see (13.61)), we found that the kinetic energy of a body can be expressed as:
K = 1
2 M V 2 +
N∑
i=1
1
2 m i v2
cm,i , (15.1)
where the first term is related to the motion of the center of mass and describes the
kinetic energy for the translational motion. The second term is related to the motion
relative to the center of mass. For a rigid body, the only way a part of the body
can move relative to the center of mass is by rotation. We therefore interpret the
second term as kinetic energy for the rotational motion, and we will here introduce
the kinetic energy for rotating objects. An object can rotate either around a fixed axis
or around a moving axis such as a moving center of mass. Here, we first address the
behavior of a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis, and then generalize to the case
of an axis following the center of mass motion.

Fig. 15.1 a A rod is rotating around an axis O through its center of mass. b A rod is rotating around
an axis P through another point P along the rod
Rotation Around a Fixed Axis
The rotation of an object around a fixed axis is illustrated by the motion of a rotating
rod in Fig. 15.1. As we saw when we discussed rotations, the rod may rotate around
an axis through its center of mass (the axis O in the figure), or it may rotate around
an axis through some other point along the rod (the axis P in the figure). These two
rotations are clearly different. It is therefore important to realize what we mean by
a rotation around an axis: We mean that the object is rotating around a line. A line
can be specified by a point and a vector. It is not sufficient to specify the rotation
by a vector alone. In both cases in Fig. 15.1 the object is rotating with the angular
velocity ω. The two axes are parallel, but they go through different points. You should
therefore always ensure that when you make a sketch of a rotating system, you clearly
mark what point or what axis the object is rotating about.
In order to determine the kinetic energy of the rigid body we assume that the body
consists of small mass-points with masses m i and positions, ri , where the positions
are measured relative to an origin placed on the rotation axis. The whole body is
rotating with the angular velocity ω around the fixed axis through the origin, O. We
place our coordinate system so that the z-axis points in the direction of ω: ω = ω k,
What is the velocity of point i on the body? From our discussion of rotations, we
know that the velocity of a point on a rotating body at a position ri is:
vi = ω × ri . (15.2)
We can simplify the description by decomposing the position into two vectors: the
vector ρi , directed normal to the z-axis, and the vector z i k directed along the z-axis
as illustrated in Fig. 15.2:
ri = ρi + z i k . (15.3)

Using this expression, the velocity is:

We write:
ρi = ρi ˆuρ , (15.5)
where ˆuρ is a unit vector pointing radially out from the axis to the point at ri . The
velocity is therefore:
vi = ωρi

where the unit vector ˆu T points in the tangential direction.

the rigid body about the axis O:
I O =

15.2 Kinetic Energy of a Rotating Rigid Body 461
And we can write the kinetic energy for the rotating body as:
Kinetic energy for rotation about the axis 0:
K = 1
2 I O ω2 . (15.9)
Notice that the moment of inertia is a property of the object and the axis of rotation: It
does not depend on how the object rotates around this axis. We interpret the moment
of inertia as the rotational inertia of an object around an axis. The rotational inertia
tells us how difficult it is to spin an object: The larger the moment of inertia, the
larger energy is needed to obtain a certain angular velocity.
The expression K = (1/2)I O ω2 in (15.9) is analogous to the expression for the
translation kinetic energy for an object, K = (1/2)Mv2 . The mass M appears in one
equation, while I O , which involves both the mass and how it is distributed around
an axis, occurs in the other.
Rotation Around an Axis Through the Center of Mass
Figure 15.3 illustrates the motion of a rod thrown across a room: An example we
used to introduce rotational motion in Chap. 14. In this case the object is subject to
both translational and rotational motion. The kinetic energy of this object is given
by (15.1) as:
K = 1
2 M V 2 +
N∑
i=1
1
2 m i v2
cm,i . (15.10)
If the rod is a rigid body, the only possible motion relative to the center of mass
is a rotational motion, as illustrated by the motion of the rod seen in the center of
mass system in the bottom right part of Fig. 15.3. We can then use exactly the same
argument we used above for rotation around a fixed axis, and find the kinetic energy
for rotation around an axis through the center of mass is:
N∑
i=1
1
2 m i v2
cm,i = 1
2 I cm ω2 . (15.11)
The total kinetic energy is therefore:
K = 1
2 M V 2 + 1
2 I cm ω2 . (15.12)

15.3 Calculating the Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia around an axis O of a system of particles with masses m i at
positions ri is:
The moment of inertia around an axis O: is defined as
I O = ∑
i
m i ρ2
i . (15.13)
where ρi is the distance from particle i to the axis O.
Notice that the moment of inertia is not only a property of the object, it also depends
on the axis of rotation, and the moment of inertia of a given object around different
axes may be different, as illustrated below. A common mistake is to forget that the
moment of inertia depends both on the object and on the axis, and that the moment
of inertia changes if we change the axis.

Fig. 15.4 Illustration of a hammer where all the mass is located in the point P in the head of the
hammer. The hammer rotates around the point O, and the moment of inertia of a hammer depends
on the distance R from the rotation axis to the hammer head
The moment of inertia depends on both the mass and how it is distributed around
the rotation axis. Figure 15.4 illustrates a hammer consisting of a heavy head of mass
M attached to an effectively massless rod. (You can assume that all of the mass of
the head is located in the marked point, P). The moment of inertia of the hammer is
I O = M R2 , (15.14)
where R is the distance from the head, P, to the rotation axis O. We can therefore
change the moment of inertia by changing the mass of the head, or by changing the
distance from the head to the rotation axis. If you rotate it as a pendulum from your
hand this corresponds to changing your grip (point O), since this will change the
position of the rotation axis. As you move your grip closer to the head, the moment
of inertia becomes smaller, and it becomes easier (requires less energy) to give
the hammer a certain angular velocity. Pulling mass in towards the axis of rotation
reduces the moment of inertia, pushing it further out from the axis increases it.
464 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodies
Solid Bodies
The mass of the hammerhead is not really located in a point P, it is distributed in
space around this point. The moment of inertia of the hammerhead is therefore not
zero even if the rotation axis is located at the center of the head. To calculate the
moment of inertia of a continuous body—a solid—such as the hammerhead, we must
sum all the contributions from a continuum of points corresponding to small volume
elements ΔVi with mass Δm i = ρM ΔVi , where ρM is the local mass density of the
solid. The sum over all points i in the solid becomes an integral when the size of a
each element goes to zero:
I O = ∑
i
Δm i ρ2
i = ∑

ρM ρ2 d V , (15.15)
where the integral is over the solid body. The moments of inertia around the center
of mass of various solid bodies are shown in Fig. 15.5. Examples of how to calculate
the moment of inertia of an object using integration are shown below.
Fig. 15.5 Moments of inertia for various solid bodies
15.3 Calculating the Moment of Inertia 465
The moment of inertia of a hammerhead of dimensions h × w × d (h is height, w
is width, and d is depth) around its center O can be found from Fig. 15.5, where we
see that the moment of inertia of a plate around its center is
I cm = 1
12 M
(
h2 + w2)
. (15.16)
This is therefore the real moment of inertia of the hammer when R = 0 m in the
example above.
Parallel-Axis Theorem
We have now found a way to calculate the moment of inertia for a continuous object
such as the hammer. But what if we now want to know the moment of inertia of the
hammerhead for a different rotation axis—what if we want to know it as a function of
the distance, R, from the center of the hammerhead to the rotation axis as illustrated
in Fig. 15.6?
We could of course calculate the moment of inertia using the integral formulation
in (15.15) for each position of the rotation axis. But this is cumbersome. Fortunately,
it turns out that it is sufficient to calculate the moment of inertia around an axis
through the center of mass. From this moment of inertia, we can find the moment of
inertia around any other parallel axis using the parallel-axis theorem:
Parallel-axis theorem: The moment of inertia, I O , of an object around an
axis O is related to the moment of inertia, I cm , of the object around a parallel
axis through the center of mass of the object by:
I O = I cm + Ms2 , (15.17)
where M is the mass of the object, and s is the distance between the axis O
and the parallel axis through the center of mass.

Fig. 15.7 Illustration of the parallel-axis theorem. The moment of inertia around an axis C through
the center of mass can be used to find the moment of inertia around an axis O—if the axis O is
parallel to the axis C through the center of mass. The vector s is perpendicular to both axes, and
points from the origin of axis C to the origin of axis O
(You can find a proof in Sect. A.5). The theorem is illustrated in Fig. 15.7. We can
use the parallel-axis theorem to find the moment of inertia around any axis if we only
know the moment of inertia around the center of mass. This is why you usually only
find tabulated the moment of inertia of an object around its center of mass: Given
this, you can use the parallel-axis theorem to find the moment of inertia for any other
parallel axis.
We can use the parallel-axis theorem to find the moment of inertia of the hammer
as a function of the distance R from the center of the hammerhead to the rotation
axis—it is simply given by:
I O = I cm + M R2 , (15.18)
as long as the two rotation axes are parallel. This allows us to calculate the moment
of inertia for any R—as illustrated in Fig. 15.4.
Superposition Principle
Still we are not satisfied with our characterization of the hammer, because it consists
of two pieces: hammerhead and shaft. So far we have assumed that the mass of
the shaft is negligible and that we therefore can neglects its moment of inertia.
What if cannot neglect it—what to do then? We are saved by a principle called
the superposition principle: For an object that consists of several parts, such as the
hammerhead and the shaft of a hammer, we can find the moment of inertia around
an axis by summing the moments of inertia for each part around the same axis:
15.3 Calculating the Moment of Inertia 467
The moment of inertia of two systems A and B round the axis O is the sum of
the moments of inertia for each part of the systems:
I O,AB = I O,A + I O,B . (15.19)
(You can find a proof in Sect. A.4). We can therefore find the moment of inertia
of a compound object by summing the moments of inertia for each of the object. Just
be careful to ensure that you sum moments of inertia around the same axis.
This allows us to find the moment of inertia of the hammer illustrated in Fig. 15.6
as the sum of the moment of inertia of the hammerhead and the shaft:
I T OT,O = I h,O + I s,O , (15.20)
where we have already found that the moment of inertia of the hammer is:
I h,O = 1
12 M
(
h2 + w2)
+ M R2 . (15.21)
The moment of inertia of the shaft around the point O can be found just as for the
hammerhead. The moment of inertia around the center of mass for the shaft is found
from Fig. 15.5:
I s,cm = 1
12 m L2 , (15.22)
and we use the parallel-axis theorem to find its moment of inertia around point O,
which is at a distance L/2 from the center of mass:
I s,O = 1
12 m L2 + m
( L
2
)2
= 1
3 m L2 . (15.23)
The total moment of inertia of the hammer around the point O is therefore:
I T OT,O = 1
12 m L2 + 1
12 M
(
h2 + w2)
+ M R2 , (15.24)
where R = L + h/2 for this configuration.

15.4 Conservation of Energy for Rigid Bodies
We have found the kinetic energy of a rigid body that is either rotating around a
fixed axis or that is rotating around its moving center of mass. If the solid body is
only affected by conservative forces, we may use energy conservation principles to
470 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodies
determine the relation between angular velocity and position, just as we have done
with translational velocity and position previously. But in order to employ energy
conservation, we need to determine the potential energy of a rigid body.
Potential Energy for a Constant Gravitational Force
What is the potential energy for a rigid body due to the gravitational force? We found
that for a point particle with mass m i at the position ri , the potential energy due to a
constant gravitational force directed along the y-axis is:
Ui = m i gyi . (15.33)
We often call a constant gravitational force a homogeneous gravity, since gravity
is the same everywhere. The total potential energy for multiparticle system of N
particles is therefore:
U =
N∑
i=1
Ui =
N∑
i=1
m i gyi = g ∑
i=1
m i yi
︸ ︷︷ ︸
=MY
= M g Y , (15.34)
where Y is the position of the center of mass. This result is general, and is also valid
for a rigid body:
Potential energy of a rigid body for a constant gravitational force
U = M g Y . (15.35)
Potential Energy Due to a Spring Force
A rigid body may also be affected by a force modelled by a spring force. This force
may have several origins. It may represent a contact force due to an elastic contact;
a contact force due to a rope or string attachment; an approximation for a more
complex force acting on a single part of the rigid body; or as a force acting on all
parts of the rigid body.
First, we start from the simplest case, where a spring is acting on a particular point
on the rigid body. We illustate this situation by the contact between a sphere and an
elastic floor for example while the rod is bouncing off the floor (see Fig. 15.10). We
can then model the force from the floor on the sphere using a spring model, where

that can rotate around point O, but it is attached with a spring at point P. The other end of the spring
is attached at the point Q
we assume that the force depends on the position of a particular point, the point P,
on the sphere. If the surface is horizontal at y = y f , the spring models a vertical
normal force from the floor:
F = −k( p y − y f ) , (15.36)
when the sphere is in contact with the floor, that is when p y < y f , where p y is the
vertical position of the point P. The potential energy of the sphere due to this spring
force is then:
U ( p y ) = 1
2 k ( p y − y f
)2 . (15.37)
For the sphere, we see that the position of point P is related to the center of mass of
the sphere, p y = Y − R, where Y is the vertical position of the center of mass, and
R is the radius of the sphere.
This result is not only valid for a sphere, but for another body affected by a spring
force. The potential energy of a spring force is related to the elongation of the spring.
We therefore need to relate the motion of the rigid body to the elongation of the
spring by relating for example the position of the center of mass of the body or the
rotation angle θ of the body to the elongation of the spring. This is illustration by
the rod on the right in Fig. 15.10: The rod can rotate freely around the point O, but
is affected by a spring attached to the rod at the point P and to the wall at the point
Q, so that when the rod is parallel to the wall, corresponding to θ = 0, the spring
is in its equilibrium position. The potential energy in the spring then depends on the
distance between P and Q, which for small rotation angles θ can be approximated
as ΔQ P  Rθ, where R is the distance from P to O. The potential energy due to
the spring force affecting the rotating rod is therefore:
U s (θ) = 1
2 k (ΔQ P)2 = 1
2 k R2θ2 . (15.38)
472 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodies
If the rod also is subject to gravity, we must also add the potential energy due to
gravity:
U g (θ) = −Mg D sin θ , (15.39)
where D is the distance from O to the center of mass of the rod. The total potential
energy of the rod is then U = U s + U g .
If you want to use a spring force model for a rigid body, you must therefore
consider how to describe it in detail. We will introduce several ways to model such
interactions in the following, but generally you are left to your own ingenuity.
Conservation of Energy for a Rigid Body
How can we now put the pieces together and use conservation of energy of a rigid
body relate its velocity (angular and translational) to its position (rotational and
translational)? As long as the system is only subject to conservative forces, the total
energy of a rigid body is:
E = K + U = 1
2 M V 2 + 1
2 I cm ω2 + U . (15.40)
For a rigid body the potential energy can only depend on the translational and rota-
tional motion of the body and not on the internal deformation. We have therefore
only included one term for the potential energy: The potential energy due to external
forces.
If the object is rotating around a fixed axis—an axis that does not move—we can
simplify the kinetic energy, getting
E = 1
2 I O ω2 + U . (15.41)
These two equations ((15.40) and (15.41)) forms the basis for using energy conser-
vation to solve problems with rigid bodies.
15.4.1 Example: Rotating Rod
Problem: Find the angular velocity for a rod that rotates without friction about an
attachment point at one of its ends. The rod starts in a horizontal position. You can
neglect air resistance.
15.4 Conservation of Energy for Rigid Bodies 473
Approach: We use an energy argument to relate the angular velocity of the rod to its
position based on the kinetic energy of a rotating rigid body and the potential energy
of a solid body affected by gravity.
Solution: How can we address this problem with what we have learned so far? Can
we use Newton’s laws of motion? Not really, because we do not know the forces
acting in the attachment point. Normal forces will be present in this point—but we
do not have a model to determine their magnitude.
What about energy conservation? We know how the kinetic energy of the rod
depends on the angular velocity, and we know the potential energy of the rod in
the gravity field. But is the mechanical energy conserved in this case? There are
no frictional forces and no air resistance. The only external forces acting are the
normal force in the attachment point and gravity. The force acting on the attachment
point does no work, because this point is not moving! And we know that the work
done by gravity can be expressed as a potential energy. We can therefore use energy
conservation to solve this problem!
Identify: We start from a sketch of the system in Fig. 15.11. The rod has a length L.
Its position is given by the angle θ, and the rod starts at θ = 0. Our task is to find the
angular velocity as a function of θ. We choose a positive rotational direction, which
means that the angle θ in Fig. 15.11 is negative!
Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy of a rigid rod rotating around the z-axis through
O is given as:
K = 1
2 I z ω2 , (15.42)
where I z is the moment of inertia for the rod around the axis z through O. For a rod
rotating around a fixed axis, this is the only term for the kinetic energy.
Caution: Notice that for an object rotating around a fixed axis you use the term
K = (1/2)I ω2 for the kinetic energy, where ω is the angular velocity around the
fixed axis. If you instead want to seperate the kinetic energy into the motion of the

474 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodies
center of mass and the rotation around the center of mass, you have to figure out
what the angular velocity around the center of mass is, which may not be the same
as the angular velocity around O. A frequent mistake is the confuse the two cases of
rotation around a fixed axis and rotation around the center of mass.
Potential energy: From (15.35) we found that the potential energy of a solid body
due to gravity is
U = M g Y , (15.43)
where Y is the vertical position of the center of mass of the object. For a homogenous
rod, the center of mass is located at its geometric center, that is at a distance L/2
from the end. What is the vertical coordinate of this position? From Fig. 15.11 we
see that of the center of mass is:
Y = L
2 sin θ . (15.44)
This is a negative number as long as θ is negative (and larger than −π). The potential
energy of the rod is therefore:
U = −Mg L
2 sin θ . (15.45)
Solve: The total energy of the rod is conserved since all the forces are conservative
(or not doing any work on the body), the total energy, E = K + U , is conserved.
The total energy is therefore the same in the initial position, 0, when θ = θ0 = 0,
and in the position 1, when the angle is θ:
E0 = K0 + U0 = E1 = K1 + U1 , (15.46)
where
E0 = K0 + U0 = 1

and

15.4 Conservation of Energy for Rigid Bodies 475
where we get two solutions, a positive and a negative solution, depending which way
the rod is swinging. Both directions are possible solutions: For every angle θ the rod
will first swing one way, then swing the other way. Since there are no damping it
will continue swinging back and forth indefinitely.
Analyze: We have found a general solution, valid for the rotation of any type of
homogeneous staff of length L. The solution depends on the moment of inertia for
the staff. If the staff is slim, we know that the moment of inertia around the center
of mass is:
Icm = 1
12 M L2 , (15.50)
but the rod is not rotating around the center of mass, instead we need to find the
moment of inertia around the end-point of the rod, that is, around the axis z. We use
the parallel-axis theorem to find this, since the rod is rotating around an axis parallel
to an axis through the center of mass of the rod. The distance s from the center of
mass to the axis z in point O is L/2. The parallel-axis theorem therefore gives:
I z = Icm + Ms2 = 1

Test your understanding: How would your results change if the rod was not homogeneous, but
instead had all its mass located in a point at a distance L from the attachment point?
15.5 Relating Rotational and Translational Motion
For a wheel rolling along a surface or for a rope running over a spinning wheel,
the rotational and translational motion of the objects are related: If the wheel is to
roll without slipping the center of the wheel must move a distance equal to the path
“rolled out” by the wheel, and for the rope to run over the spinning wheel without
slipping the length of rope pulled from the wheel must correspond to the length a
point on the wheel has moved (see Fig. 15.14). How do we introduce such relations
between the rotation and the motion of the object?
476 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodies
Fig. 15.12 Illustration of a wheel rolling without slipping (left) and a rope running over a spinning
wheel without slipping (right)
Rolling Motion
The left part of Fig. 15.12 illustrates the motion of a wheel that is rolling without
slipping. What does this mean? That it is rolling wihtout slipping? It means that the
distance moved by the center of the wheel during a time interval Δt must correspond
to the distance “rolled out”—the distance moved by a point on the surface of the
wheel in the same time interval. Alternatively, we could say that the point P on
the wheel that is in contact with the floor, does not move relative to the floor (see
Fig. 15.13). This point must therefore have zero velocity relative to the floor. Let us
find an expression for the point P. We do this by first finding the velocity of the point
x
y
p cm
Fig. 15.13 Illustration of rolling condition: The point P is at a position pcm = −R j relative to the
center of mass
15.5 Relating Rotational and Translational Motion 477
relative to the center of mass, and then adding the velocity of the center of mass to
find the velocity relative to the ground. In the center of mass system (a system with
an origin that moves with the center of mass), the wheel is rotating around the origin.
The velocity of P relative to the center of mass is therefore the velocity of a point
moving in a circle around the origing with angular velocity ω:
v P, cm = ω × pcm , (15.53)
where pcm is the position of point P relative to the center of mass. If we place the
origin at the center of mass, we find that
pcm = −R j , (15.54)
as illustrated in Fig. 15.13. The angular velocity is:
ω = ω k , (15.55)
and therefore
vP,cm = ω k × (−R) j = ωR i . (15.56)
The velocity of point P relative to the ground is found by adding the velocity of the
center of mass relative to the ground (using the Galilei-transformations):
vP = vcm + P, cm = V + ωR i . (15.57)
The wheel is rolling if this is zero:
vP = V + ωRi = 0 ⇒ V = −ωR i . (15.58)
Are the signs in this equation correct? Yes. If Vx is positive we see that ω must be
negative, as expected.
Rolling condition: If the condition Vx = −ωR is satisfied, the wheel is rolling
without slipping. This relation is called the rolling condition. If this condition
is not satisfied, the contact between the wheel and the ground is moving relative
to the ground, and we say that the wheel is sliding. This condition is often used
to determine when a wheel starts rolling without sliding.
Caution: A common mistake is to use the rolling condition also in the case when the
wheel is slipping. The rolling condition is only valid in the case of rolling without
slipping.
478 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodies
15.5.1 Example: Weight and Spinning Wheel
Problem: A weight of mass m is hanging from a massless rope that is wound around
a spinning wheel of mass M and radius R. The spinning wheel can rotate without
friction around its attachment point at the center of the wheel. The weight is released
from rest. Find the velocity v of the weight as a function of its height h. You may
neglect air resistance.
Approach: We plan to use energy conservation for the (wheel+weight) system. Both
the wheel and the weight has a kinetic energy, but only the potential energy of the
weight changes as it descends. The velocity of the weight and the angular velocity
of the wheel is related because they are connected by the rope. We solve to find how
the velocities depend on the position of the weight.
Solution: This problem may be addressed in several ways: We could apply Newton’s
laws of motion, but then we need a law for rotational motion. We learn that in
Chap. 16, and we return to this example then. The problem can also be addressed
using energy conservation—energy is conserved for the complete system consisting
of the spinning wheel, the rope, and the weight since the only external forces are
gravity, which is a conservative force, and the force acting at the attachment point of
the spinning wheel—and this force does no work since the spinning wheel does not
move.
Identify: The system consists of the weight, the rope, and the spinning wheel (see
Fig. 15.14). The weight of mass m has the position y and velocity v, with the positive
direction of y chosed upwards. The spinning wheel rotates with an angular velocity
ω around its attachment point at its center (of mass). Positive rotational direction is
chosen according to the right hand rule, and is shown with the arrow indicating the
angular velocity ω. The weight starts at the position y0 = 0 with the velocity v0 = 0.
Model: Because all the external forces acting on the system are either conservative
(gravity) or not performing any work (the normal force on the axis of the spinning

wheel), we can use energy conservation. The total energy is E = K m + K W + U m +
U w, where K m = (1/2)mv2 is the kinetic energy of the weight, K w = (1/2)I ω2 is
the kinetic energy of the spinning wheel, U m = mgy is the potential energy of the
weight (where y < 0 since we assume the weight to start at y = 0), and U w = Mgyw
is the potential energy of the spinning wheel (which is constant since center of mass
of the spinning wheel is not moving). Since the rope does not have any mass and
does not stretch, we do not need to include the kinetic or potential energy of the rope.
Solve: The total energy is calculated for two configurations: the initial configuration
0 where the velocity of the weight is v0 = 0 and ω0 = 0, and the position 1 where
the angular velocity of the spinning wheel is ω and the velocity of the weight is v:
E0 = K m,0 + U m,0 + K w,0 + U w,0

and
E1 = K m,1 + U m,1 + K M,1 + U M,1
= 1
2 mv2 + mgy + 1
2 I ω2 + Mgyw . (15.60)
These equations involve both v and ω. However, the motions of the weight and the
spinning wheel are related because they are connected by a massless rope. In order
for the rope not to slip along the wheel, the rope must follow the motion of the wheel
at point P. This means that the velocity of point P on the wheel must be the same
as the velocity of the rope at this point:
vP = ω × r = ω k × (−R i) = −ω R j . (15.61)
In order for the rope to remain tight and not stretch, the velocity of the rope at point
P must be the same as the velocity of the weight. We therefore have:
vP = −ωR j = v , (15.62)
which is the velocity of the weight. We insert v = −ωR into (15.60):

What is the moment of inertial I of the spinning wheel around its center of mass?

v = √2mg(−y)/ (m + (M/2)) , (15.66)
where we have chosen the negative solution for v, since we know that the weight is
moving downwards. We recall that y is negative since the weight is falling down.
Analyze: Let us test this result by checking what happens when the spinning wheel
is massless, that is when M  m. In this limit we find v = √2g(−y), which is
the result we expected. Since the velocity of the weight for finite masses of the
spinning wheel is smaller than this, the effect of the spinning wheel is to slow down
the acceleration of the weight.
15.5.2 Example: Rolling Down a Hill
Problem: You are arranging a rolling competition. Various symmetrical, round
objects of mass M, radius R, and moment of inertia I about an axis through the
center of mass, are rolled down a hill of vertical height h. Find the velocity v of the
object at the end of the hill. You may neglect the effects of air resistance.
Approach: We plan to use energy conservation: The initial potential energy is con-
verted to translational and rotational energy of the object. The rolling condition
relates translational and rotational motion.
Solution: We may use the conservation of total mechanical energy if all the forces
are conservative. A rolling object is affected by gravity, which is conservative, by the
normal force, which does no work, and by a friction force from the surface. What,
you say, friction? How can we then use energy conservation? It turns out that for an
object that is rolling without slipping, the friction force acts in the point of contact
between the rolling object and the surface, and the velocity of this point is zero. The
work done by the friction force on the object is therefore zero:
W =
∫ t1
t0
F · v dt = 0 . (15.67)

In this particular case we can therefore use energy conservation. Notice that you
cannot use energy conservation if the object is slipping!
Identify: The rolling object has mass M, radius R, and moment of inertia I as
illustrated in Fig. 15.15. The object starts at Y0 with the velocity V0 = 0 and the
angular velocity ω0 = 0. What is the velocity (of the center of mass) at Y = Y1 =
Y0 − h?
Model: The total energy of the object is E = K T + K R + U , where K T =
(1/2)M V 2 is the translational kinetic energy, related to the motion of the center of
mass, and K R = (1/2)I ω2 is the rotational kinetic energy, related to the motion
relative to the center of mass. The potential energy is due to gravity U = MgY .

We relate the translational and rotational motion using the rolling condition. As long

482 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodies
Analyze: The result depends on the ratio I /M R2 . Let us introduce the number c for
this:
c = I
M R2 , (15.71)
The number c characterizes how the mass is distributed around the center of mass.
Large values of c means that the mass is placed far from the center of mass. As more
mass is pulled towards the center of mass, c is reduced. We can find c for various
ordinary shapes. For a cylinder shell c = 1, for a cylinder c = 1/2, and for a sphere
c = 2/5. We interpret c = 0 as the case where a block is sliding without rolling on
a frictionless surface. We can find the velocity V expressed using c:
gh = 1
2 V 2 (1 + c) , (15.72)
V =
√ 2gh
1 + c . (15.73)
We see that smaller c gives larger velocities, and the object with the largest velocity
wins the race. Hence the object with the smallest value of c would win. Notice that
the results do not depend on the mass, only on how the mass is distributed around
the axis of rotation.
Test your understanding: How would you construct a rolling object with a small value of c?
Summary
A rigid body: A rigid body can be translated or rotated, but the distance between
any two points in the body does not change.
Moment of inertia:
• The moment of inertia of a multiparticle system around an axis O is: I O =∑
i m i ρ2
i , where m i is the mass of particle i, and ρi is the distance from par-
ticle i to the rotation axis O.
• The moment of inertia of a solid body with mass density ρM around an axis O is:
I O = ∫∫∫ ρM ρ2 d V , where ρ is the distance from the element d V to the axis O.
• Moments of inertia are added according to the superposition principle: The
moment of inertial of two systems A and B around the axis O is the sum of
the moments of inertia for each of the systems: I O,AB = I O,A + I O,B
• The Parallel-axis theorem: The moment of inertia I O of an object around an axis
O can be found from the moment of inertia of the object around an parallel axis
through the center of mass of the object, Icm : I O = Icm + Ms2 , where s is the
distance between the axis O and the center of mass.
15.5 Relating Rotational and Translational Motion 483
Energy of a rotating body:
• The kinetic energy of a rigid body rotating around the axis O is: K = (1/2)I O ω2 ,
where ω is the angular velocity around the axis O.
• The potential energy of a rigid body in a homogeneous gravity field is: U =
MgY , where Y is the vertical position of the center of mass of the system.
Relating translational and rotational motion:
• For two objects connected by a thin, non-elastic rope, the point of contact with the
rope must have the same speeds for both objects.
• An object is rolling without slipping along a surface if the point in contact with
the surface has zero velocity relative to the surface.

Projects
15.11 Micro-electromechanical system. In this project you will learn about the
moment of inertia, and the potential and kinetic energy of a rotating object, and we
will use this to study a simple electromechanical system, similar to a micro-mirror
used in most modern projectors.
Modern production techniques for microscopic systems allows us to construct
small mechanical elements made of silicon. For example, we can construct small
silicon cantilevers with dimensions down to a few micrometers. In this project we
will address the motion of a thin, microscopic beam using energy techniques.
First, let us consider a small, square mechanical element of dimensions L × L × h
and mass M. We assume that the thickness h is so small that we can neglect the finite
thickness of the square. The square is attached with a hinge at one of the ends of
length L. The hinge follows the y-axis as show in Fig. 15.19.
(a) Find the position R = X i + Y j of the center of mass of the square. The origin
is in one of the corners of the square.
(b) Show by integration that the moment of inertia, I cm,y , for rotations around an
axis parallel with the y-axis going through the center of mass is I cm,y = M L2/12.
(c) Find the moment of inertia, I y , for rotations around the y-axis.
The micromechanical cantilever we want to study is a bit more complicated than a
single square. We can construct the cantilever from four identical squares, each with
dimensions L × L and masses M, as illustrated in Fig. 15.20. The squares are rigidly
attached to each other, so that they move as a single body. At the edge, along the

about this axis.
(d) Show that the center of mass of the cantilever is R = X i + Y j = (5/4) L i +
(L/2) j.
(e) Show that the moment of inertia, I y for the whole object is I y = (22/3) M L2 . Hint
1: You can calculate the moment of inertia for each part of the object independently
and sum the results. (This is called the superposition principle). Hint 2: Use the
parallel-axis theorem to find the moment of inertial around the y-axis for each part
of the object.
Even though we are considering a microscopic system, where the effect of gravity
typically will be negligible, let us first consider the motion of the cantilever when it is
affected by gravity. For a real microscopic cantilever the effects of electrostatic forces
is typically more important. Often such interactions results in a constant electrostatic
force on the cantilever. The results from studying the behavior of the cantilever when
affected by gravity as we do here can therefore easily be translated into the behavior
of a cantilever affected by electrostatic forces.
The gravitational force acts in the negative z-direction. As a result of gravity, the
cantilever rotates and angle θ around the y-axis as illustrated in Fig. 15.21.
(f) Show that the potential energy of the cantilever due to the gravitational force
is U G = −5M Lg sin θ, where the potential energy is zero when the cantilever is
horizontal.
(g) Assume that the cantilever starts with an initial angular velocity ω0 = 0 when
θ = 0. Find the angular velocity of the cantilever, ω(θ), when it has reached the
angle θ.
In the following, we will no longer assume that the cantilever rotates freely around
the y-axis. Instead, we will assume that it bends around a hinge along the y-axis, and
488 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodies
that the bending is like the bending of an elastic body. This means that there is an
potential energy associated with the bending. The potential energy of the cantilever
when it is bent an angle θ due to the stiffness of the hinge is U h = (1/2) κ θ2 where
κ is a constant that depends on the material properties (and the size) of the hinge.
(h) Again, assume that the cantilever starts with an initial angular velocity ω0 = 0
when θ = 0. Find the angular velocity of the cantilever, ω(θ), when it has reached
the angle θ.
(i) Describe the motion of the cantilever.
For small θ we can approximate sin θ  θ. We will use this approximation in the
following.
(j) Find the maximum angle θ of the cantilever when it is released as described above.
(k) Draw an energy diagram in the form of the total potential energy of the cantilever
as a function of θ. Can you find any equilibrium points for the cantilever?
Small cantilevers are used for many technological applications. For example, pro-
jectors using the DLP technlogy consists of a vast number of micromirrors, small
cantilevers that reflect light. When an electrical field is applied to the cantilever, the
cantilever is affected by an electrostatic force. We can describe this in the same way
as we described gravity above, but the electrical field can be turned on or off. As a
result, the cantilever can be bent, and the light is reflected in a different direction. You
can look at other interesting applications by searching for MEMS in your favourite
search engine.
Chapter 16
Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
How do you spin a ball? And how do you jump-spin on skates? In this chapter
you learn what causes changes in rotational motion using Newton’s second law for
rotational motion.
You know how to describe the rotation of a wheel around a fixed or moving axis,
using the angle, the angular velocity, and the angular acceleration of the wheel. And
you know how to find the kinetic energy of a rotating rigid body. But what causes
changes in rotational motion? For translational motion we can use Newton’s second
law to determine the change in the translational state, in the translational momentum,
from the external forces acting on a body. We use this both to find the acceleration
of a body, and from the acceleration we can calculate the motion, and to find conser-
vation laws for the translational momentum. Can we find a similar law for rotational
motion? In this chapter we will introduce the rotational analogue to translational
momentum: rotational momentum or angular momentum; the rotational analogue to
force: torque; and the rotational analogue to Newton’s second law: Newton’s second
law for rotational motion. Armed with these tools you will see that you are ready
to solve any problem of moving and rotating rigid bodies, such as figuring out what
causes a ball to spin or how you jump-spin on skates.
16.1 Motivating Example—Spinning a Wheel
Increasing the Angular Velocity of a Spinning Wheel
Figure 16.1 shows how a wheel is spun by a force F applied to a pedal, which is
attached to a lever, which again is attached to the wheel. The wheel accelerates—it
increases its angular velocity from ω0 = 0 rad/s to ω as the wheel rotates an angle θ.
We can find the angular velocity ω as a function of θ from the work-energy theorem.
The work done by F is:

Fig. 16.1 We spin up a bicycle wheel by applying a force F of constant magnitude to an arm
attached to the axis of the wheel. The wheel rotates around a fixed axis at its center, and the distance
from the axis to the point where the force is applied is R
W =
∫ t
t0
F · v dt , (16.1)
where v is the velocity of the point where the force is acting, that is, the velocity of
the pedal. The pedal rotates around a fixed axis, the axis of the wheel, and therefore
moves in the tangential direction:
v = v ˆu T . (16.2)
We can similarly decompose the force in the tangential and normal direction
F = FT ˆu T + F N ˆu N , (16.3)
as illustrated in Fig. 16.1. It is only the tangential component that contributes to the
work. The normal component does no work since there is no motion in this direction.
If we apply a constant tangential force, FT , and this is the only force acting, the work-
energy theorem gives:
W = FT s = FT Rθ = K1 − K0 , (16.4)
where the distance s = Rθ moved by the pedal depends on the distance R from the
rotation axis to the point where the force is acting. The change in kinetic energy of
the rotating wheel is:
K1 − K0 = 1
2 I ω2 − 1
2 I ω2
0 , (16.5)
16.1 Motivating Example—Spinning a Wheel 491
If we insert this into (16.4) and assume that we start from rest, ω0 = 0, we get:
FT Rθ = 1
2 I ω2 ⇒ ω2 = 2FT R θ
I . (16.6)
How does this compare with our intuition? We see that the rotational inertia, I ,
plays an important role: If we increase I but keep everything else fixed, the resulting
angular velocity gets smaller: It becomes more difficult to get the wheel started if I
is larger.
In addition, the angular velocity depends on how large the force FT is and how
far, R, from the rotation axis it is applied. First, we notice again what we already
observed: It is only the tangential component of F that matters: We cannot accelerate
the rotation of the rod by pulling at it in the radial direction. Second, we see that it is
the combination τ = FT R that matters. This combination is often called the torque
of the force F. We can therefore increase the final angular velocity by increasing the
force FT or by increasing the distance R from the axis where the force is applied.
Angular Acceleration of a Spinning Wheel
Can we use this approach to find the angular acceleration? Yes! By applying the
method to a very short time interval. As the interval becomes smaller and smaller,
we effectively introduce the time derivative of both sides of (16.4). For the rotational
system in Fig. 16.1, the work done by the constant, tangential force FT is
W = FT RΔθ = 1
2 I ω2(t + Δt) − 1
2 I ω2(t) . (16.7)
when the wheel rotates an angle Δθ during the short time interval Δt. We divide by
Δt on both sides:
FT R Δθ
Δt =
1
2 I ω2(t + Δt) − 1
2 I ω2(t)
Δt , (16.8)
This becomes the time derivative as Δt becomes small:
FT R dθ
dt = d
dt
( 1
2 I ω2
)
= I ω dω
dt , (16.9)
where we have applied the chain rule and assumed that I is constant. Finally, by
dividing by ω on both sides:
FT R = I dω
dt = I α = d
dt I ω , (16.10)
492 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
we have found the angular acceleration! This equation looks very much like Newton’
second law for translational motion:
F = m dv
dt = ma = d
dt mv . (16.11)
For rotational motion, we replace:
The force by the torque F → FT R
The translational inertia (mass) by the rotational inertia m → I
The acceleration by the angular acceleration a → α
(We can derive Newton’s second law from the work-energy theorem in exactly the
same way.) Equation (16.10) is indeed Newton’s second law for rotational motion.
This law is general, even though it was here derived for a special situation.
Interpreting Newton’s Second Law for Rotations
From Newton’s second law for rotational motion in (16.10), we interpret the torque
R FT = τ as the cause of the angular acceleration, just as we interpreted the force as
the cause of acceleration for translational motion. We see that I plays the role of a
rotational inertia. For a given torque, τ = FT R, a larger value of I means a smaller
angular acceleration. Also, we see that the torque τ = FT R depends on both the
tangential force, FT and the distance to the rotation axis, R: If we apply the same
force F further out from the rotation axis, we get a larger torque and a larger angular
acceleration.
The top figures in Fig. 16.2 illustrates how we must increase the force as the
distance R changes in order to keep the same torque and therefore the same angular
acceleration: If we increase R we have to decrease FT by the same factor to keep the
acceleration the same. This is illustrated in the figure, where we have shown arms of
length R/2, R and 2R and the corresponding forces, 2F, F, and F/2.
The bottom figures in Fig. 16.2 shows what happens when we keep the torque the
same, but change the moment of inertia. If we assume that the mass is concentrated in
two weights attached to a thin rod, the moment of inertia is I = 2Mr2 , where r is the
distance from the center of the rod to the center of each of the masses. From Newton’s
second law for rotational motion in (16.10), we find the angular acceleration:
α = FT R
I . (16.12)
If the torque, FT R is constant, the acceleration depends inversely on I . We illustrate
this by showing the orientations of the object at three subsequent (but not equally
spaced) timesteps. All these systems have the same mass. It is how the mass is distrib-
uted around the rotation axis that matters. And as evident, changing the distribution
has a significant effect on the acceleration.

While Newton’s second law for rotational motion was introduced in the special
situation of a constant force, we will in the rest of this chapter see that the law is
general, and you will learn how to apply it to determine the rotational motion of a
system.
16.2 Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion
In the introductory example we introduced the following law for the rotational motion
of an object subject to a single, constant force:
τ = FT R = I α , (16.13)
where τ = FT R is called the torque for the force F. The torque depends only on the
tangential component of F. This is the component that is normal to the vector from
the rotation axis to the point where the force acts, r, as illustrated in Fig. 16.3. You

may recall to have seen this before. We recognize the torque as the magnitude of the
cross product between r and F. This is easily seen by decomposing r and F in the
normal (radial) and tangential directions: r = r ˆu N and F = FT ˆu T + F N ˆu N . The
cross product is then:
r × F = r ˆu N × FT ˆu T + r ˆu N × F N ˆu N = r FT k , (16.14)
where ˆu N × ˆu N = 0, and ˆu N × ˆu T = k is a unit vector that point out of the plane,
in the z-direction. This allows a more general definition of the (vector) torque of the
force F around the point O:
Definition of torque:
τ O = r × F , (16.15)
where r is the vector from O to the point where F is acting.
The torque, FT R, in (16.13) is therefore the z-component of the vector torque:
τz = FT R = I α . (16.16)
In the introductory example we discussed the effect of a single force, producing
a single torque. However, an object may be subject to several forces, all acting in
separate points, giving rise to separate torques. The work-energy theorem used in
the example depends on the net force. Hence we must insist on using the net torque
when formulating Newton’s second law for rotational motion. 1
1 Notice that the torque τ points in the z-direction, which is also the direction of the rotation
vector, ω = ω k. This suggests a vector formulation of Newton’s second law for rotational motion:∑ τ j = I α. Unfortunately, this is generally not correct. We will return to a vector formulation
later.
16.2 Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion 495
Newton’s second law for rotational motion (N2Lr): for a rigid body rotating
around a fixed axis (the z-axis) is:
∑
j
τz, j = τ net
z = I z αz , (16.17)
where τ j = r j × F j is the torque of force j, r j is the position of the point
where force j is applied, and I z is the moment of inertia (the rotational inertia)
of the object around the rotation axis.
Structured Problem-Solving Approach
This law allows us to determine the rotational motion of a rigid body, just like we
previously have found the translational motion of an object using Newton’s second
law. We can follow the same structured problem-solving approach as we used for
translational motion, but with some modifications as illustrated in Fig. 16.4.
There are a few, but important differences between how we address problems
with translational and rotational motion. When we identify the relevant systems and
variables for rotational motion around a fixed axis, we must of course describe the
configuration of the object using the angle θ and the angular velocity ω. When we
model the system, we still start from a free-body diagram of the rotating object, but
we must now carefully specify the rotation axis and where each of the forces are
acting, because this is essential in order to calculate the torque. We find the torque
for each of the external forces acting, and add them all to get the net torque, which

we use in Newton’s second law for rotational motion. When we solve and analyze
the system, we follow the same structure as we have done before, now working with
angular coordinates.
Torque
In order to apply Newton’s second law for rotation and solve rotational problems,
we must know how to calculate the torque:
τ O = r × F , (16.18)
of the force F around the point O. What are the properties of torque?
• The torque of a force depends on the point it is taken relative to—the origin. We
say that the torque is around the point O to show where the origin is when we
calculate the torque.
• The torque of a force F depends both on the force and on the position r where
the force is acting. For example, the torque around point O of the force F on the
hammer in Fig. 16.5 varies from τ = F L k when the force is applied at the end of
the hammer to τ = 0 when the force is applied at the rotation axis.

16.2 Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion 497
• The torque is given as a cross product: The torque is therefore normal to both
the position vector rand the force F. We find the direction of the torque using the
right-hand rule.
• For a two-dimensional system in the x y-plane, the torque is always directed along
the z-axis. We often use the z-component τz of the torque instead of the full vector
notation for the torque. The sign of τz indicates if the torque is in the positive or
negative z-direction.
• The direction of the torque is normal to the position and force vectors, and its
magnitude is:
|τ | = |F| |r| sin φ , (16.19)
where φ is the angle between the position vector r and the force vector F as
illustrated in Fig. 16.3.
• If the force is parallel to the position vector, the torque is always zero for this force.
For example, for a weight in a rope whirled in a circular path, the torque of the
rope tension around the center of the path is always zero, since the rope tension
acts in the direction of the position vector. Similarly, the torque of the gravitational
force from the Sun on the Earth (taken around the Sun) is also always zero.
• If the position vector r is zero, that is, if the force acts in the origin, the torque of
the force is zero. This is commonly used “trick” to solve problems: If we place
the origin at a force we do not know, its torque is zero independently of the force.
• Torques obey the superposition principle. The total torques of a force F1 acting
at the point r1 and the force F2 acting at the point r2 is:
τ = τ 1 + τ 2 = r1 × F1 + r2 × F2 . (16.20)
Notice that you can only add torques that all are taken around the same point!
• To calculate the torque of a the gravitational force acting on a rigid body (when
gravity is a constant) you assume that the total gravitational force acts in the center
of mass:
τ = R × Mg , (16.21)
where R is the position of the center of mass. This is found by summing all the
torques acting on each small element i of the rigid body:
τ = ∑
i
ri × m i g =
(∑
i
m i ri
)
× g = MR × g = R × Mg . (16.22)
Test your understanding: Why does it require less force to close a door if you push far from the
hinge than if you push near it?

16.2.1 Example: Torque and Vector Decomposition
Figure 16.6a illustrates a force F applied to a wrench, at a point r relative to the
rotation axis, which is placed in the origin. While we can always find the torque
directly from
τ = r × F , (16.23)
if we know r and F. However, it is often practical to decompose either the force F
or the arm, r, in order to simplify the calculation of the torque.
If you decompose the force, F into a component Fr = Fr ˆu r in the direction along
r and a component Fn = Fn ˆu n in the direction normal to r, the torque is
τ = r × F = r × (Fr ˆu r + Fn ˆu n
) = r × Fr ˆu r + r × Fn ˆu n = r Fn k . (16.24)
since the force component along r does not contribute to the torque - it is only the
component of F normal to the arm that contributes.
Alternatively, you could decompose the arm r into a component rF = r F ˆu F in
the direction along F, and a component rN = r N ˆu N in the direction normal to F as
illustrated in Fig. 16.6b. The torque is then:
τ = r × F = (r F ˆu F + r N ˆu N
) × F = r N F˛, (16.25)
which shows that it is only the component of the arm that is normal to the force that
contributes to the torque. With experience you will learn to use the method that is
simplest in a given situation.

16.2.2 Example: Pulling at a Wheel
Problem: A force F is applied tangentially at the rim of a wheel made of a homoge-
neous cylinder of mass M and radius R. (You may think of this as pulling at a rope
with a constant force, where the rope is wrapped around the wheel and unwinds as
you pull). The wheel starts at rest and is attached to a frictionless axis at its center.
Find the angle θ of the wheel as a function of time.
Approach: We use Newton’s second law for rotational motion since the wheel rotates
around a fixed axis: We find the forces and where they are acting, then we find the
torques, calculate the angular acceleration, and integrate to find the motion.
Identify: The rotational position of the wheel is described by the angle θ, with
positive direction shown in Fig. 16.7. The wheel starts at θ0 = 0 with angular velocity
ω0 = 0 at t0 = 0.
Model: The external forces acting on the wheel are: gravity, G, acting in rG = 0 at
the center of mass of the wheel; the contact force N from the axis on the wheel acting
in rN = 0 at the axis (notice that N has to balance the two other forces, because
the center of mass of the wheel does not move), and the force F = −F i, acting at
rF = R j at the rim of the wheel.
The torques of both gravity and the normal force are zero, since rG and rN are
zero. The torque of F around O is:
τ F = rF × F = R j × −F i = R F k , (16.26)
which is the net torque around the origin. The z-component, the component along
the rotation axis, is τz = R F. Newton’s second law for rotatational motion around a
fixed axis gives:
τ net
z = R F = I z α , (16.27)
where I z is the moment of inertia of the wheel for rotation around the axis, which
goes through the center of mass of the wheel. We find I z from Fig. 15.5. We insert
this into (16.27), getting:

which is a constant. The initial conditions for the motion are: ω(0) = ω0 = 0 and
θ(0) = θ0 = 0.

from (16.28).

Analyze: Notice that the method used is exactly the same as the method we used to
solve problems with translational motion, but now we use Newton’s second law for
rotational motion instead of Newton’s second law for translational motion.
16.2.3 Example: Blowing at a Pendulum
Problem: A pendulum consists of a sphere of radius R and mass M. The center
of the sphere is attached at the end of a thin, massless rod of length L. The other
end revolves around a bolt, providing a fixed, friction-free axis for the pendulum.
The sphere is affected by air resistance, which you for simplicity can assume to act
at the center of the sphere. You can use a quadratic law for the air drag. Develop
a method to find the motion of the pendulum when affected by a horizontal wind,
w(t) = w(t) i, which may vary in time, and explore the behavior of the pendulum
for various types of winds.
Approach: The pendulum is rotating around a fixed axis. We can therefore solve the
problem using Newton’s second law for rotational motion: From the forces acting
we introduce force models, find the torques, find the angular acceleration from the
net torque, and solve to find the motion.
Identify: We measure the position of the pendulum by the angle, θ, with the vertical
as shown in Fig. 16.8. We need to define initial conditions for the motion, and assume
that the pendulum starts at θ0 = 0 and with initial angular velocity ω(t0) = ω0 at
t0 = 0 s.
Model: We find the forces acting on the pendulum from the free-body diagram (see
Fig. 16.8). The pendulum is affected by gravity G = −Mg j. To calculate the torque
of gravity, we assume it acts ate the center of the mass, which is at the center of the

sphere, since the rod is without mass. The gravitational force is therefore drawn in
the center of the sphere, at rG = r, where r is a vector pointing from the rotation
axis O to the center of the sphere.
From the figure, we see that
r = L sin θ i − L cos θ j . (16.31)
The torque of gravity is:
τ G = r × G , (16.32)
which we find by inserting the vector for G and r:
τ G = (L sin θ i − L cos θ j) × −Mg j = −MgL sin θ k . (16.33)
The air resistance, FD = −D|v − w|(v − w), also acts at the center of the sphere,
rD = r. Here, v is the velocity of the center of the sphere and w is the velocity of the
air. When there is no wind, w = 0, and the air resistance reduces to the well know
form, FD = −Dvv. What is v? We can find the velocity of any point on a rotating
rigid body using v = ω × r. The torque of FD is:
τ D = rD × FD , (16.34)
where rD = r. For the general case where an external wind w is applied, we need to
calculate this based on the wind. However, it is useful to see that we get a simplified
result when w = 0 and FD consequently is directed along v. Then
τ D = r × −Dvv . (16.35)
Because r is normal to v, we get r × v = Lv k. (Ensure you get the same by applying
the right-hand rule). If we insert v = ωL we get
502 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
τz,D = −DL3|ω|ω . (16.36)
This expression also ensures that we get the right sign for the torque both when
ω > 0 and when ω > 0. Check that you also get this!
The pendulum is also affected by a contact force, N, from the attachment bolt.
In reality, the contact force is distributed along the contact between the bolt and the
rod, but here we assume that the contact force acts so close to the rotation axis, that
the distance rN  0, and the torque of the force is zero.
For no wind (w = 0), the z-component of the net torque is therefore:
τ net
z = τz,G + τz,N + τz,D = −MgL sin θ − DL3|ω|ω . (16.37)
And Newton’s second law for rotational motion gives:
I α = τ net
z = −MgL sin θ − DL3|ω|ω . (16.38)
The moment of inertia, I , can be related to the moment of inertia of a sphere around
its center of mass, I cm = 2/5M R2 (from Fig. 15.5) using the parallel-axis theorem:
I = I cm + M L2 .
Solve: While you may be able to solve the motion of the pendulum for a limited
range of motion for small θ, we concentrate here on the general numerical approach.
Without Wind
When there is no wind, the motion is determined from (16.38), giving
α = − MgL
I sin θ − DL3
I |ω|ω , (16.39)
with initial conditions θ(t0) = θ0 = 0, and ω(t0) = ω0 . We solve using Euler-
Cromer’s method (see (14.21)), implemented by:
from pylab import *
rho = 7000.0 # kg/mˆ3
R = 0.02 # m
L = 1.0 # m

omega[i+1] = omega[i] + alpha*dt
theta[i+1] = theta[i] + omega[i+1]*dt
t[i+1] = t[i] + dt
The resulting motion is shown in Fig. 16.9. Here, you see that the system first
rotates completely around the axis, before damping limits the motion to an oscillation.
For the presented simulation we used L = 1 m, R = 0.01 m, mass density ρm =
7000 kg/m 3 , and D = 12ρair R2 (from (5.20)) as seen in the program.
With Wind
What happens if we want to include an external wind field, w = w(t) i, which may
vary with time? Then the torque of the air resistance force becomes more complicated:
τ D = rD × FD , (16.40)
where rD = r, which is given in (16.31), and
FD = −D|v − w|(v − w) , (16.41)
where v = ω × r, and ω = ω(t) k. Fortunately, it is simple to implement this
numerically by calculating the cross-product directly in the numerical implementa-
tion. We must only remember to extract the z-component of the calculated torque
and use this to calculate the angular acceleration. Let us start by assuming that the
wind is described by the function wind(t), which returns the value of w(t) for
a given time. We start by assuming that the wind blows with a constant velocity,
w(t) = w0 = 20.0 m/s, and let the pendulum start at rest, ω(t0) = 0 rad/s. This is
implemented by:
def wind(t):
#WIND Returns the wind veocity w(t) at the time t
w0 = 20.0; % m/s
return w0
504 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
and the integration loop of main program is now:
G = array([0,-M*g,0])
for i in range(n-1):
r = array([L*sin(theta[i]),-L*cos(theta[i]),0.0])
tauG = cross(r,G)

xlabel(’x [m]’)
ylabel(’y [m]’)
axis([-L,L,-L,L])
axis(’equal’)
where we also have included an animated plot to show the motion of the pendulum.
The test for mod(i,10)==0 is a test to check if the counter i is divisible by 10.
This means that what is inside the if-statement will only be executed every time i
is increased by 10. This is a standard way to speed up the animation by only plotting
some of the results. You need to select an appropriate number here depending on
your computer to get a smooth motion. If it is moving too slowly you need to increase
the number 10 to a large value. If it is moving too fast you should lower the number.
The resulting behavior is illustrated in Fig. 16.10, where we see that the pendulum
now does not return to θ = 0, but rather reaches a stationary situation with θ =,
which corresponds to the equilibrium configuration, that is the configuration where
the net torque is zero. You may solve to find the value of θ corresponding to zero
torque for yourself.
What happens if we now blow in a more complicated way, such as by blowing
periodically, but always in the positive direction. We can model this using the cosine:
w(t) = w1
2 (1 + cos(2πt/T )) , (16.42)

where w1 is the maximum wind velocity and T is the period of the wind. This is now

w1 = 20.0 # m/s
T = 1.0 #s
w = 0.5*w1*(1.0 + cos(2*pi*t/T))
return w
Now, we start the pendulum from θ(t0) = 0 and ω(t0) = 0rad/s, corresponding to
the case where it hang straight down at rest before you start blowing periodically at
it. The resulting behavior for T = 0.5 s, 1.0 s, 2.0 s and 4.0 s is shown in Fig. 16.11.
What happens here? Play around with the model yourself to find out what happens.
16.3 Rotational Motion Around a Moving Center of Mass
Figure 16.12 shows a rod being thrown across the lecture hall. After it has been
thrown it is just affected by gravity and air resistance. We know that the motion of
the center of mass of the object only depends on the external forces acting on the
object—its motion is determined from Newton’s second law of motion. But what
about the rotational motion around the center of mass? The rotational motion around
the center of mass for a ridig body (rotating around a fixed axis) is determined from
Newton’s second law for rotational motion around the center of mass. (A proof is
found in Sect. A.11)
Newton’s Second Law of Translational Motion
The motion of the center of mass of a rigid body, such as the rotating rod in Fig. 16.12
is determined from Newton’s second law for translational motion:
∑
j
Fext
j = MA . (16.43)
This is true irrespective of how the system moves relatively to the center of mass.
This means that the motion of the center of mass of the rod in Fig. 16.12 would be
the same if the rod rotated or if it moved with the same angle all the time. But only if

the external forces are the same! If we include the effects air resistance, the external
forces depend on whether the rod is rotating or not, and the motion would not be
exactly the same in the two situation.
Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion Around the Center of Mass
For a system rotating around a fixed axis through the center of mass, the rotational
motion is determined by Newton’s second law for rotational motion around the center
of mass, which is just like Newton’s second law for rotation around a fixed axis, but
now all the torques must be taken around the center of mass:
τ cm = rcm × F , (16.44)
where rcm is a vector from the center of mass to the point where the force F acts.
Using this notation, we get:
Newton’s second law for a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis through
the center of mass (the z-axis) is:
∑
j
τz,cm, j = τ net
z,cm = I z,cm αz , (16.45)
where τ cm, j is the torque of force j around the center of mass, and I z,cm is
the moment of inertia (the rotational inertia) of the object around the fixed
rotational axis through its center of mass.
It may be confusing to call the axis fixed if it is moving along with the center of mass.
What we mean is that the axis has a fixed direction: The direction of the rotation axis

Fig. 16.13 Top The motion of a rigid rod thrown through the air, showing the motion of the center
of mass and the rotational motion around the center of the mass. The rod hits the floor, and bounces
back up. Bottom Free-body diagram for the rod at five different times. When the rod is not in contact
with the floor (the first and the last inset) only gravity acts. When the rod is in contact with the floor
(middle three insets) both gravity and a contact force from the floor act
does not change during the motion, but the position of the axis follows the center
of mass. The application of the law is illustrated in Fig. 16.13. Here, we follow a
rod thrown across the lecture hall also during its collision with the floor. The small
insets at the bottom shows the forces acting on the rod at five different time steps.
When the rod is not in contact with the floor, the only external force acting is gravity
(we ignore air resistance), and since gravity acts in the center of mass, the torque of
gravity around the center of mass is zero, and the angular acceleration is therefore
zero: The rod rotates with a constant angular velocity. However, when the rod is in
contact with the floor, as illustrated in the middle three insets, the contact force F
from the floor on the rod gives rise to a net torque around the center of mass, which
leads to an angular acceleration during the contact. The force F acts at the point rcm
relative to the center of mass of the rod, giving rise to a torque: τ = rcm × F around
the center of mass. We address the motion of a bouncing rod in Sect. 16.3.3.
16.3.1 Example: Kicking a Ball
Problem: You are kicking a stationary football lying on the ground. The ball is
spherical, with a mass M, radius R, and moment of inertia I around the center of
mass. You kick the ball with a constant force F = Fx i for a short time interval Δt.

Fig. 16.14 You are kicking a ball—exerting a constant force F = Fx i for a small time interval Δt.
The force is acting at a distance y from the center of mass
hitting the ball at a distance y from its center, as illustrated in Fig. 16.14. Find the
motion of the ball during and after the kick. You may neglect the effects of friction
and air resistance.
Approach: We plan to use Newton’s second law of motion to find the motion of
the center of mass from the external forces acting, and Newton’s second law for
rotational motion around the center of mass to find the rotational motion around the
center for the ball during and after the kick.
Identify: We assume that the ball behaves as a rigid body and describe its motion
by the position, R(t) of its center of mass and its angle θ(t) around the z-axis. The
ball starts from rest: R(0 s) = 0 and θ(0 s) = 0.
Model: The translational and rotational motion depends on the external forces acting.
The ball is affected by gravity, G = −Mg k, acting at the center of mass, hence
rG,cm = 0; the normal force N = N k from the ground, acting at rN ,cm = −R k;
and the force F = F i from the foot, acting at rF,cm = −x i + y j, where x and y
are given. All the positions are relative to the center of mass, since the acting points
of the forces will move with the center of mass as the ball starts moving. The forces
are illustrated in Fig. 16.14.
We apply Newton’s second law to find the motion of the center of mass:
∑
j
Fext
j = −Mg k + N k + F i = MA . (16.46)
Since the applied force F only acts in the x-direction, we assume that the ball does
not move in the y or z-directions. Therefore, the acceleration in the z-direction is
zero and N = Mg. The motion in the x-direction is given by:
M A x = Fx ⇒ A x = Fx
M , (16.47)
16.3 Rotational Motion Around a Moving Center of Mass 509
starting from Vx = 0 m/s and X = 0 m at t = 0 s. Notice that the motion of the
center of mass does not depend on the rotational motion of the ball, since (16.47)
and the time, Δt, the force is acting does not depend on either the angle θ or the
angular velocity ω of the ball!
The rotational motion of the ball is found from Newton’s second law for rotational
motion around a fixed axis around the center of mass. (How do we know the ball
rotates around a fixed axis? We know, since the direction of the torque does not
change during the motion—this is an advanced point we will return to later in the
chapter. For now you should consider this an assumption):
∑

where θ(0 s) = 0 and ω(0 s) = 0 rad/s.
Solve: Both the translational and the rotational motion occur with constant accelera-
tions. We can therefore solve by direct integration to find the positions and velocities.

However, this solution is only valid as long as the ball is affected by the force F,
which only is for a time interval Δt. After that, the ball is not affected by the force
F, and the net force in the x-direction is zero and the net torque is zero. Therefore
the translational and the rotational accelerations are zero, and the ball continue with
the same translational and rotational velocities:
V (t) = V (Δt) = F
M Δt when t > Δt , (16.55)
and
ω(t) = ω(Δt) = − y F
I Δt when t > Δt . (16.56)
Since the motion for t > Δt occurs with constant translational and angular velocities,
it is easy to find the position at a time t > Δt by integration:
X (t) = X (Δt) + V (Δt)(t − Δt) when t > Δt , (16.57)
and
θ(t) = θ(Δt) + ω(Δt)(t − Δt) when t > Δt . (16.58)
Analyze: We notice that the motion of the center of mass does not depend on y—the
position where the force is acting. For any choice of y, the effect on the motion of
the center of mass is the same. But the rotational motion depends on y. In particular,
we notice that when y = 0, that is when the force acts on an axis through the center
of mass, the net torque is zero, and the ball does not start to rotate. We also notice
that if we kick the ball on the left side, with y > 0, the ball rotates in the negative
direction, whereas if we kick the ball on the right side, with y < 0, the ball rotates
in the positive direction, which is consistent with our experience with kicking balls.
This is how you give them spin.
Comment: Notice that the translational and rotational motions are independent in
this case. Why? Because the force acts at a constant distance y from the center
of mass throughout the motion. Therefore the torque of F does not depend on the
16.3 Rotational Motion Around a Moving Center of Mass 511
position of the ball, and similarly, the direction or magnitude of F does not depend
on the rotation of the ball. This is not always the case: In many cases the two motions
are coupled because the force acting on the object depend either on the position of
the object or on its rotation. But in this particular case—as well as in many cases in
typical mechanics exam problems—the two motions are not coupled.
16.3.2 Example: Rolling down an Inclined Plane
(This problem is a classic in mechanics.)
Problem: A round object is placed on an inclined plane. The object has radius R,
mass M, and moment of inertia I around the rotation axis through the center of
mass. Find the acceleration of the object and the friction force on the object. Discuss
various angles of inclination φ, various objects, and various initial conditions for the
object.
Approach: We plan to find the external forces and use Newton’s second law of
translational and rotational motion to find the acceleration, using the rolling condition
as long as the object is rolling.
Identify: We choose a coordinate system with the x-axis oriented along the inclined
plane, so that there is no motion in the y-direction. (See Fig. 16.15). The object
is described by the position X (t) of its center of mass, and the rotational angle,
θ(t), around the center of mass. The object starts at the position X (0 s) = 0 m, and
θ(0 s = 0 with initial velocities Vx = V0 , and ω(0 s) = ω0 .
Model: The object is affected by a normal force, N = N j, acting at rN ,cm = −R j;
a friction force, f = − f i, acting at r f,cm = −R j; and a gravitational force G acting
at the center of mass, rG,cm = 0. We decompose the gravitational force in the chosen
coordinate system:
G = Mg sin φ i − Mg cos φ j . (16.59)

We apply Newton’s second law to determine the translational acceleration:
∑
j
Fext
j = G + N + f = MA . (16.60)
In the x-direction:
∑ Fx = Mg sin φ − f = M A x . (16.61)
Since there is no motion in the y-direction, we get
∑ Fy = N − Mg cos φ − f = M A y = 0 , (16.62)
which gives N = Mg cos φ.
Newton’s second law for rotation around the center of mass gives:

which inserted in (16.63) gives:

z = −R f = I α . (16.65)
We now have 2 equations, (16.61) and (16.65), but 3 unknowns, A x , α, and f . How
do we proceed?
The main challenge in this problem lies in the friction force. In the case where
the friction is dynamic, that is, if the object is sliding relative to the surface, the
magnitude of the friction force is simply proportional to the normal force, and the
direction is determined from the local relative velocity of the two surfaces in contact.
However, if the object does not slide, the friction force is a static friction force, and
its magnitude must be determined from other principles.
Let us first assume that the object is not sliding relative to the surface. This means
that the object is rolling without slipping. The rolling condition is that there is no
relative velocity at the contact point, P, vP = 0, where
vP = V + vP,cm = V + ω × rP,cm = Vx i + ω k × (−R j) = (Vx + ωR) i ,
(16.66)
16.3 Rotational Motion Around a Moving Center of Mass 513
and the condition v p = 0 therefore gives Vx = −ωR, which is usually called
the rolling condition. Taking the time derivative gives a similar expression for the
accelerations: A x = −Rα, which we insert this into (16.65), getting:
f = − I
R α = − I
R
−A x
R = I
R2 A x . (16.67)
The static friction force must have this value to ensure that there is no slipping
between the object and the surface. We insert this result into (16.61), giving:
Mg sin φ − f
︸︷︷︸
=(I /R2)A x
= M A x
Mg sin φ =
(
1 + I
M R2
)
M A x ,
(16.68)
and
A x = g sin φ
1 + I
M R2
. (16.69)
We introduce c = I /(M R2) to simplify the expression:
A x = 1
1 + c g sin φ . (16.70)
The number c depends on the distribution of mass around the rotation axis. For a
sphere, c = 2/5, for a cylinder c = 1/2, and for a ring, c = 1.
The friction force is:
f = I
R2 A x = Mg sin φ
I
M R2
1 + I
M R2
= Mg sin φ c
1 + c . (16.71)
It is clear that the friction force f increases with φ, and at the same time N decreases
with φ. When will the friction force reach the static friction threshold? The objects
starts to slip at the critical angle φc when f = μs N , where we now insert the values
we found for f and N , getting:
Mg sin φc
c
1 + c = μs Mg cos φc ⇒ tan φc = μs
1 + c
c . (16.72)
The critical angle φc depends on the number c—it will therefore depend on the type
of object rolling. For a few characteristic objects we have:
514 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
Object I tan φc
Sphere (2/5)m R2 (7/2)μs
Cylinder (1/2)m R2 3μs
Ring m R2 2μs
A sphere will therefore roll down a steeper slope than a cylinder, which will start
slipping at a lower angle than the sphere.
What happens if the slope is steeper than φc? In this case the object will still
rotate, but it will not roll without slipping. This means that the rolling condition is
no longer valid. Instead the friction force is now the dynamic friction force, which
only depends on the normal force:
f = μd N = μd Mg cos φ . (16.73)
We insert this into Newton’s second law for translational motion, (16.61), getting:
Mg sin φ − μd Mg cos φ = M A x , (16.74)
which allows us to determine A x independently of the rotational motion:
A x = g (sin φ − μd cos φ) . (16.75)
However, the object will still rotate, since the torque around the center of mass is:
τz = −R f = −Rμd Mg cos φ = I α . (16.76)
The angular acceleration is therefore:
α = − R f
I = −μd
R Mg cos φ
I . (16.77)
16.3.3 Example: Bouncing Rod
In this example we will develop a model for a bouncing rigid rod. The model will
be similar to the bouncing an rotating dumbbell model in Chap. 13, but we will now
model a rigid rod, so there are no internal vibrations, and we will use our newly
gained knowledge of how to model rotating rigid object for our model.
The rod is of length L = 1 m, mass M = 0.5 kg, and has a moment of inertia
I = (1/12)M L2 around its center of mass. We describe the rod by the position R(t)
of its center of mass and the angular orientiation θ(t), where we assume that the rod
moves in the x y-plane and rotates around an axis through the center of mass directed
along the z-axis.

Fig. 16.16 Illustration of the rod bouncing on the floor and free-body diagram for the rod
The motion of the rod is determined by the forces acting on it. The rod is affected
by gravity, G = −Mg j, acting at the center of mass, rG,cm = 0. In addition the
rod will bounce on the floor. We model the force between the floor and the rod as
a spring force, representing the deformation of the floor and the rod. If either end
of the rod is pressed into the floor, that is, if the y-coordinate of either end is below
y = 0, which is the position of the floor, there will be a spring force acting normal
to the floor, in the positive y-direction, which depends on how far the end of the rod
has been pressed down into the floor. The two ends of the rod are at positions:
rA = R + (L/2) ˆu , (16.78)
rB = R − (L/2) ˆu , (16.79)
where ˆu = cos θ i + sin θ j is a unit vector pointing along the rod, as illustrated in
Fig. 16.16. The normal force, NA, due to the interaction between end A of the rod is:
NA =
{ −ky A when y A < 0
0 when y A ≥ 0 . (16.80)
and similarly for end B:
NB =
{ −ky B when y B < 0
0 when y B ≥ 0 . (16.81)
Here, k is the spring constant for the interaction between the rod and the floor.
The motion of the rod is determined from Newton’s second law for translational
and rotational motion:
∑
j
F j = G + NA + NB = MA , (16.82)
516 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
and
∑
j
τz,cm, j = I α , (16.83)
where
∑
j
τ cm, j = 0 × G + rA,cm × NA + rB,cm × NB . (16.84)
Here, rA,cm = (L/2) ˆu and rB,cm = −(L/2) ˆu. Notice that both the net force and
the net torque depends on both the position of the center of mass and on the angle,
since the contact force between the rod and the floor depends on the position and
orientiation of the rod.
Numerical: It is not simple to solve these equations analytically, but it is straight
forward to implement a numerical solution. We use an Euler-Cromer scheme to
integrate both the translational and the rotational motion, simultaneously:
V(t + Δt) = V(t) + A(t, R(t), θ(t)) Δt
R(t + Δt) = R(t) + V(t + Δt) Δt
ω(t + Δt) = ω(t) + α(t, R(t), θ(t)) Δt
θ(t + Δt) = θ(t) + ω(t + Δt) Δt ,
(16.85)
This scheme can be implemented directly into the code, using Newton’s second laws

16.4 Collisions and Conservation Laws
If a meteor collides with a planet (see Fig. 16.18), the planet may gain both transla-
tional and rotational motion after the collision. We have already found that conser-
vation principles, such as the conservation of translational momentum, allow us to
determine the translational motion of the planet after the collision without knowing
the details of the interactions during the collision. Can we find similar concepts and
conservation laws for rotational motion—a rotational momentum and a conservation
law for rotational motion—which we can use to address the rotational motion of a
system during a collision? Here, we introduce the concept of rotational momentum
first for a point particle, then for a system of many particles, and finally for a rotating
rigid body, before we put all the pieces together and formulate a set of general prin-
ciples allowing us to address collisions between several rigid, rotating object—such
as during a meteor impact or during a pirouette.
Rotational Momentum for a Point Particle
We have already found that the translational momentum, p, is a useful concept to
address collisions. This is based on the prominent place of translational momentum
in Newton’s second law:
∑
j
F j = dp
dt . (16.86)
Fig. 16.18 A meteor impact on a planet may change both the translational and the rotational motion
of the planet. The arrows show the translational momentum and the blue dot shows the rotational
state of the planet after the collision
16.4 Collisions and Conservation Laws 519
It is indeed this law that justifies the conservation law: When the net external force
is zero, the time derivative of the translational momentum is zero and therefore
conserved throughout the process. Let us see if we can justify a similar concept for
rotational motion, based on Newton’s second law for rotational motion:
τ net = ∑
j
r j × F j . (16.87)
If we study the motion of a point particle, all the torques act in the same point, r, and
the net torque is:
τ net = ∑
j
r × F j = r × ∑
j
F j = r × Fnet , (16.88)
where we can insert Fnet from Newton’s second law in (16.86):
τ net = r × dp
dt . (16.89)
In order to get something that looks like Newton’s second law in (16.86), we try to
move the time derivative out in front of r × p: What does this give?
d
dt (r × p) = dr
dt × p + r × dp
dt = v × mv︸ ︷︷ ︸
=0
+r × dp
dt = r × dp
dt . (16.90)
Yes! Success! We can therefore rewrite (16.89) as:
τ net = d
dt (r × p) = d
dt l . (16.91)
This equation looks just like Newton’s second law—we have found what we have
looking for, l = r × p is the rotational analogue for translational momentum. We
call l the rotational momentum or the angular momentum :
lO = r × p (Rotational momentum) , (16.92)
where we use the subscript O to show that the rotational momentum is found with
respect to the point O, and the vector r is found relative to O. We say that lO is the
rotational momentum around the point O or around an axis z (if the particular point
along the axis is not important).
Properties of Rotational Momentum
• Rotational momentum is a vector. For planar motion, the rotational momentum
is normal to the plane.
• The rotational momentum is calculated relative to a point—just like torque. It will
be different if we choose a different point.

Fig. 16.19 Illustration of rotational momentum l = r × p for circular motion and motion along a
straight line
For a particle moving in a circle with radius r, in the x y-plane, as illustrated in
Fig. 16.19, the velocity v is always normal to the position r, and the rotational momen-
tum around the origin at the center of the rotational motion is:
l = r × mv = rmv k . (16.93)
The rotational momentum can be defined for any moving point particle, not only for
a rotating point particle. For example, the rotational momentum of a particle moving
along a straight line at x = b, r = b i + y(t) j, is:
l = r × mv = (b i + y(t) j) × v y j = bv y k . (16.94)
As illustrated in Fig. 16.19 this means that it is only the component of r that is normal
to v that contributes to the rotational momentum, similar to what we previously found
for torques.
Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion of a Point Particle
We have found an alternative formulation of Newton’s second law for a point particle,
most useful for rotational motion, but valid for any motion:
τ net = d
dt l , (16.95)
Conservation of Rotational Momentum
Based on Newton’s second law in (16.95) we see that for a point particle, the rotational
momentum, l, is conserved if the net external torque is zero! While this can be used
to address problems with a single particle, it first becomes really useful when we
introduce similar concepts for a rigid body or a system of many particles.

r0 from the hole. We pull slowly in the rope until it reaches the radius r with the
angular velocity ω. Find ω.
Identify: As long as the rope is tight, the block moves in a circular path with radius
r. We describe the position of the block by the radius r and its angle θ, as illustrated
in Fig. 16.20.
Model: First, we find the forces acting on the block. The block is affected by gravity,
G, and the normal force, N, from the table. Since the block is not moving in the
vertical direction, the net vertical force is zero, and since two forces are acting in
the same point, the net torque of the two forces (around any point) is also zero. In
addition, the block is affected by the rope tension, T.
We use Newton’s second law for rotational motion to determine the motion of the
block. The torque around the origin of the rope tension is:
τ T = r × T = 0 , (16.96)
because the force and the position vector are parallel. This means that the net torque
around the origin is zero. Newton’s second law for rotational motion therefore gives
that:
dl
dt = τ = 0 , (16.97)
the rotational momentum is therefore constant throughout the motion. The rotational
momentum for the block is:
l = r × mv , (16.98)
where the velocity is normal to the radius vector at all times, therefore:
l = rmv˛. (16.99)
522 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
We can replace the velocity by the angular velocity, using v = Rω:
l = mr2ω˛, (16.100)
which is what we found above for circular motion.
Analyze: Since the rotational momentum is conserved, we can relate the initial and
final states. Initially, the rotational momentum is:
l0 = mr2
0 ω0˛. (16.101)
When the radius is r and the angular velocity ω:
l = mr2ω˛. (16.102)
Since l = l0 we find ω:
mr2
0 ω0 = mr2ω ⇒ ω = r2
0
r2 ω0 . (16.103)
This demonstrates the use of the conservation principle for rotational momentum.
Rotational Momentum for a System of Particles
The rotational momentum of a system of particles around a fixed point, O, is the
sum of the rotational momentum of each particle. For a system consisting of point
masses, m i , located at points, ri , the total rotational momentum is:
LO = ∑
i
lO,i = ∑
i
ri × pi = ∑
i
ri × m i vi . (16.104)
Similarly, we define the rotational momentum of a system of particles around their
center of mass as
Lcm = ∑
i
lO,i = ∑
i
rcm,i × pi = ∑
i
rcm,i × m i vi , (16.105)
where rcm,i is the position of mass m i relative to the center of mass. The rotational
momentum of a system around a fixed axis O can also be decomposed into the
rotational momentum of the center of mass around O, assuming the center of mass
moves as a point particle, and the rotational momentum of the system around its
center of mass:
LO = R × P + Lcm , (16.106)
16.4 Collisions and Conservation Laws 523
where R is the position of the center of mass (relative to O), and P is the translational
momentum of the whole system. (You can find a proof of (16.106) in Sect. A.10).
Newton’s Second Law of Rotation for a Multiparticle System
Also for a multiparticle system, we find a general form for Newton’s second law for
rotational motion:
Newton’s second law for rotational motion of a system of particles around
a fixed point O:
dL0
dt =
N∑
i=1
ri × Fext
i = τ ext
0 , (16.107)
where only the external forces are included. The internal forces cancel as long
as they are central forces.
(You can find a proof in Sect. A.8). We can also derive a completely analoguous law
for the rotational momentum around the center of mass of a system:
Newton’s second law for rotational motion of a system of particles around
its center of mass, cm:
dLcm
dt =
N∑
i=1
rcm,i × Fext
i = τ ext
cm , (16.108)
where the positions rcm,i are the positions of each mass m i relative to the center
of mass of the system.
(You can find a proof in Sect. A.11). This law is general and powerful. You will find
it used frequently both theoretically, as basis for derivations, and practically, as a
basis for the use of conservation laws. The law also demonstrates that as long as the
torque of the external forces are constant, around a fixed point O or the center of
mass, the corresponding total rotational momentum does not change. This is the law
for rotational motion we have been looking for. However, in order to apply it to the
collision of rigid bodies, we need to find a simplified expression for the rotational
momentum of a rigid object, both around a fixed axis and around its center of mass.

Rotational Momentum for a Rigid Body
We know that the translational momentum of a rigid body can be written as P =
MV, where V is the velocity of the center of mass. Can we find a similarly simple
expression for the rotational momentum, LO of a rigid body around a fixed axis?
The rotational momentum for a rigid body is rotating around a fixed axis z through
the point O. 2
LO = ∑
i
ri × m i vi , (16.109)
For a rigid body rotating around the axis z with an angular velocity ω = ωk, each
mass m i at ri has a velocity:
vi = ω × ri . (16.110)
To simplify the expression, we introduce cylindrical coordinates to describe the
position of mass i, where the cylindrical axis follows the z-axis, as illustrated in
Fig. 16.21. The position is decomposed as:
ri = ρi + z i k = ρi ˆuρ + z i k , (16.111)
where ˆuρ is a unit vector in the x y-plane pointing from the z-axis to the point ri , as
shown in Fig. 16.21. We insert this into (16.110), getting:
vi = ω × ri = ω k × (ρi + z i k) = ω k × ρi + ω k × k︸ ︷︷ ︸
=0
= ω × ρi . (16.112)
We find the rotational momentum by inserting this into (16.109):
2 Notice that O must be a point on the rotation axis.
16.4 Collisions and Conservation Laws 525
LO = ∑
i
ri × m i vi = ∑
i
m i ri × (ω × ρi ) . (16.113)
Hmm. How do we simplify this equation? If we only are interested in the z-component
of the rotational momentum (which we typically are when we use Newton’s second
law for rotational motion of a rigid body), we see that it is only the ρi component of
ri that contributes to the z-component of LO :
LO,z k = ∑
i
m i ρi × (ωk × ρi ) = ∑
i
m i ρ2
i ωk , (16.114)
because the vectors ρi and vi are normal to each other, and the vectors ρi and ω are
normal to each other. Therefore:
L O,z =
(∑
i
m i ρ2
i
)
ω = I z ω , (16.115)
where we recognize the moment of inertia (rotational inertia), I z , around the z-axis.
The rotational momentum, L O,z , of a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis
is:
L O,z = I z ω , (16.116)
where I z is the moment of inertia of the object around the z-axis, and ω is the
angular velocity around the z-axis.
We can use this result also for a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis through its
center of mass. We notice that if we insert this into Newton’s second law for rotational
motion of a multi-particle system around a fixed axis in (16.107) or (16.108), we
recover Newton’s second law for rotational motion:
∑
j
τ ext
z,O, j = d
dt L O,z = d
dt (I z ω) = I z

dt = I z α , (16.117)
which was the result we started this chapter with. Notice the nice similarity between
the translational and rotational momentum of a rigid body:
Translational Rotational

Momentum P = MV L O,z = I z ω

526 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
Limitations
We have previously noted that Newton’s second law for rotations of rigid bodies
only are valid for rotations around a fixed axis. Similarly, the expression L O,z = I z ω
is only valid for rotation around a fixed axis, and it is only valid in the z-axis. But
would it not be nice if the expression was completely general:
LO = I ω . (16.118)
As you will learn later, we can formulate the relation in this way, but then I is a more
complicated quantity than a mere scalar. However, this expression is not generally
correct if I is interpreted as a scalar such as I z . (You can see a proof in Sect. A.9). We
can only use the expression in (16.118) when the rigid body is rotationally symmetric
around the z-axis. However, our results for the z-component, L O,z = I z ω, of the
rotational momentum of a rigid body are always true—as long as the body is rotating
around a fixed axis.
Putting It All Together
Finally, we want to put all these results together to address processes where we can
use conservation of rotational momentum to solve a problem without determining
the details of the motion.
Redistribution of Mass
An example of a typical process where we can use conservation of rotational momen-
tum, is the redistribution of mass within a rotating system. For example, if a skater
performing a piruoutte pulls in his arms, he changes the distribution of mass, and
therefore the moment of inertia around the rotation axis. Since the external forces
have no significant torque around the rotation axis, the rotational momentum is con-
served throughout the process:
L O,z (t0) = I z (t0)ω(t0) = L O,z (t1) = I z (t1)ω(t1) . (16.119)
If you change the distribution of mass, you change I z . To keep the rotational momen-
tum constant, you must change the angular velocity correspondingly. Pulling your
arms in while spinning reduces I z . As a result the angular velocity will increase.
Collision with Rotation Around a Fixed Axis
Another example of a typical process where we can use conservation of rotational
momentum is a collision where the bodies after the collision rotate as one rigid body
around a fixed axis. If the external torques acting on the bodies are insignificant, the
rotational momentum around the fixed axis is conserved:
L O,z (t0) = L O,z (t1) = I z (t1)ω(t1) , (16.120)

Fig. 16.22 Left A collision between a bullet and a rigid body hanging from the point O. Right A
collision between a meteor and a planet
which allows us to find the angular velocity after the collision. A typical example of
such a process is where a bullet is shot into a rigid body: Such as a meteor impacting
on a planet or a bullet shot into a rigid pendulum, as illustrated in Fig. 16.22.
Since Newton’s second law for rotational motion comes in two forms: for rotation
around an axis that is fixed in space and for rotation around the center of mass, we
must be careful to check what version is revelant in a given case. Notice that for a
fixed axis, a typical error is to assume that the net force is zero because the net torque
is zero. Unfortunately, this is generally wrong. In the case illustrated in Fig. 16.22
you cannot ignore the force from the axis on the rotating object, and the translationa
momentum is therefore not conserved, while the rotational momentum is conserved.
However, if the bodies are free to move, such as when a planet is hit by a meteor as
illustrated in Fig. 16.22, the net external force is zero, and the translational momentum
is conserved. You must therefore carefully address the net external force and the net
external torque in each situation.
16.4.2 Example: Changing Your Angular Velocity
Problem: How can you control your angular velocity if you are (a) spinning around
a pole (b) spinning while diving.
Solution: A rotating plate with a pole at its center can often be found on childrens
playgrounds. You jump onto the plate and hold the pole, and spin the plate up with
your feet. Then you can change your angular velocity by pulling yourself in towards
the pole as illustrated in Fig. 16.23. How does this work?
The only external forces acting on the system consiting of you and the plate
are gravity and the forces acting on the axis of rotation, but the z-component of
the torques of these forces are zero. The rotational momentum around the z-axis

Fig. 16.23 Left A person on a spinning disk increases his angular velocity by pulling himself closer
to the rotation axis. Right A diver changes her angular velocity around the center of mass by curling
up, but that does not affect the path taken by the center of mass significantly
is therefore conserved. When you pull yourself towards the rotation axis, you are
changing how the mass is distributed. You moment of inertia around the rotation axis
is approximately I z = M R2 , where R is the distance from you to the axis (if you
were a single point). Conservation of rotational momentum then gives:
L z (t0) = I z (t0)ω0 = L z (t1) = I z (t1)ω1 , (16.121)
M R2
0 ω0 = M R2
1 ω1 . (16.122)
where ω0 is your initial angular velocity when you are at a distance R0 from the pole,
and
ω1 = R2
0
R2
1
ω0 , (16.123)
is the angular velocity you getting. Pulling yourself towards the pole, makes R1 < R0
and therefore ω1 > ω0 : You speed up!
Similarly, if you start your dive with a small angular velocity ω0 around your
center of mass when your body is approximately stretched out in its full length, you
can increase your angular velocity, by pulling your body closer towards the center
of mass, decreasing your moment of inertia around the center of mass:
I cm,z (t0)ω(t0) = I cm,z (t1)ω(t1) . (16.124)
By stretching out again, you can decrease your angular velocity, effectively allowing
you to determine how fast you spin. However, you cannot control the motion of your
16.4 Collisions and Conservation Laws 529
center of mass: The path taken by your center of mass is determined by the external
forces acting on you, gravity and air resistance, and gravity is not affected by your
redistribution of mass. Therefore you will typically follow the same path irrespec-
tively of how you spin during your dive. (There may be small differences because
air resistance will depend both on your spin and on how your body is curled up).
16.4.3 Example: Conservation of Rotational Momentum
Problem: A fly of mass m lands at the outer rim of a spinning DVD. The disk has
mass M and radius R, and rotates with the angular velocity ω0 before the event. Find
the angular velocity of the plate after the fly has landed. (You can assume that the fly
is able to grip onto and remain attached to the plate.)
Solution: The system consists of two objects: The DVD and the fly, as illustrated in
Fig. 16.24. We choose the fixed rotational axis through the center of the DVD as the
origin.
We plan to use conservation of rotational momentum to solve the problem. The
external forces on the system consiting of the DVD and the fly, are the gravitational
forces on the disk and the fly, and the force on the disk acting in the attachment
point at the center of the disk. The gravitational force on the disk and the forces on
the disk from the attachment point in the axis do not contribute to the net torque
around the axis, since the “arm”, r, is zero for these forces. The torque due to the
gravitational force on the fly acts in the x y-plane, and its z-component is therefore
zero. The z-component of the net torque on the system is therefore zero, and rotational
momentum is conserved:
L O,z (t0) = L O,z (t1) , (16.125)

f ly
, (16.126)
where the z-component of the rotational momentum of the fly is zero since the fly is
only moving vertically when it is landing.
After the landing, the fly is moving with the same velocity as the disk. The fly has
therefore effectively changed the moment of inertia of the spinning disk, by adding
a mass m at a distance R from the axis:
I z (t1) = I z (t0) + m R2 , (16.127)
and the rotational momentum of the disk-fly system is:
L0,z (t1) = (I z + m R2)ω1 , (16.128)
Now, we can find the final angular velocity, since the rotational momentum is con-
served:
I z ω0 =
(
I z + m R2)
ω1 , (16.129)
ω1 = I z
I z + m R2 ω0 . (16.130)
Since the disk is a cylinder, we know that the moment of inertia around the center of
the disk (the center of mass) is: I z = M R2/2. The final angular velocity is therefore:
ω1 =

16.4.4 Example: Ballistic Pendulum
This problem is a classic in mechanics. It illustrates the conservation of angular
momentum during a collision.
Problem: A thin rod of length L and mass M is hanging from a point O at one end
of a the rod. A bullet of mass m is shot horizontally into the rod, and hits the rod
with the horizontal velocity v at the lower end of the rod. The bullet is stuck in the
rod. Find the angular velocity of the object immediately after the collision.
Approach: We divide the problem into two parts: The collision and the subsequent
motion. During the collision we try to use conservation of rotational momentum to

find the angular velocity after the collision. For the subsequent motion we use energy
considerations to find how high the pendulum swings.
Identify: We use the rotation axis as the origin. The bullet has an initial velocity
v0 = v i, and the rod is initially hanging straight down, with no angular velocity. The
system is shown in Fig. 16.25.
Model: The net external force is not zero throughout the collision, since the rod
is affected by forces acting in the axis. What about the net torque around O? The
external forces acting on the system is the force, N, acting on the axis, rN = 0;
the gravitational force, G of the rod; and the gravitational force Gb of the bullet.
We assume that the rod does not move much during the collision. Consequently,
the gravitational force on the rod acts approximately in the point rG = −L/2 j
throughout the collision, and similarly that the gravitational force on the bullet acts
in rb = −L j. Also, we assume that the rod is thin, so that the bullet is at x b = 0
throughout the collision—therefore, we do not have to address the horizontal position
of the bullet when we calculate the torques. The net external torque is therefore:
τ net = 0 × N + rG × G + rb × Gb , (16.132)
where all the terms are zero! Hence the net torque is zero, and the rotational momen-
tum around the point O is conserved throughout the collision.
We find the z-component of the total rotational momentum using the superposition
principle, summing the z-component of the rotational momentum of the rod and the
bullet. For the rod, L R
O,z = I z ω, which is zero before the collision when the rod
starts at rest. Immediately before the collision, the angular momentum of the bullet
around the point O is:
Lb
O = rb × mv = −L j × mv0 i = Lmv k , (16.133)
532 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
and the z-component is:
L b
O,z = Lmv . (16.134)
The total z-component of the angular momentum of the system immediately before
the collision is therefore:
L0,z = Lmv︸︷︷︸
bullet

︸︷︷︸
rod
= Lmv . (16.135)
After the collision, the bullet is attached to the rod and the bullet-rod system rotates
as a rigid body around the axis. The z-component of the rotational momentum of
a rigid body is L z = Itotω, where I is the moment of inertia. We find the moment
of inertia of the bullet-rod system using the superposition principle, summing the
moment of inertia of the rod, I , and the bullet, which we consider to be a particle of
mass m at a distance L from the rotation axis:
Itot = I + m L2 . (16.136)
The rotational momentum after the collision is therefore:
L O,z =
(
I + m L2)
ω , (16.137)
Solve: Conservation of angular momentum gives:
Lmv =
(
I + m L2)
ω ⇒ ω = Lmv
I + m L2 . (16.138)
Analyze: The subsequent motion of the rod-bullet pendulum can be determined from
Newton’s second law for rotation around the axis O.
16.4.5 Example: Rotating Rod
Problem: A thin rod of length L and mass M is lying at rest on a frictionless surface.
A bullet of the same mass, M, is shot horizontally into the rod, and hits the rod with
the horizontal velocity v at a distance y from the center of the rod. The bullet is stuck
in the rod. Find the translational and angular velocity of the object immediately after
the collision.
Approach: Since the system is not affected by any external forces, the translational
and rotational momentum is conserved, and we can use conservation laws to relate
the motion before and after the collision.
16.4 Collisions and Conservation Laws 533

Identify: The system consists of the rod and the bullet. We describe the motion of the
system by the motion of its center of mass and by the rotation of the system around
its center of mass. The system is illustrated in Fig. 16.26.
Model: The motion of the system is determined by the external forces acting on the
system. Since we can ignore frictional forces in the plane of motion, the only external
forces acting are the gravitational force and the normal force from the surface. Since
the rod is not moving vertically, the net external forces are zero. From Newton’s
second law for translational motion, this means that the (translational) momentum
is conserved throughout the collision and during the motion afterwards:
∑
j
Fext
j = d
dt P = MA = 0 . (16.139)
The center of mass of the system therefore moves with a constant velocity—before,
during, and after the collision! Notice that the translational motion does not depend
on where the bullet hits the rod—the velocity of the center of mass is the same
independently of where the bullet hits, although the position of the center of mass of
course will depend on where the bullet hits.
The velocity of the center of mass before the collision depends on the velocity of
the objects: The velocity of the rod is, vr = 0, and the velocity of the bullet is v,
hence:
(M + M) V = Mv + M0 = Mv , (16.140)
and therefore:
V = 1
2 v = 1
2 v i . (16.141)
Since the system has no velocity component in the y-direction, the y-position of the
center of mass remains constant, with the following value:
534 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
(M + M) Y = M 0 − M y ⇒ Y = −y/2 , (16.142)
as illustrated in Fig. 16.26.
Second, we determine the motion relative to the center of mass. The rod may start
rotating, depending on where the bullet hits the rod. The rotational motion around
the center of mass is related to the torque of the external forces around the center
of mass. But, since there are no external forces acting in the plane of motion, the
z-component of the external torque is zero:
τ ext = 0 . (16.143)
We apply Newton’s second law for rotational motion around the center of mass:
τ ext = d
dt Lcm = 0 , (16.144)
and find that there is no change in the rotational momentum around the center of mass:
The rotational momentum around the center of mass of the system is conserved. This
is also the case for the z-component of the rotational momentum around the center
of mass:
τ ext
z = d
dt L cm,z = 0 . (16.145)
Since we know the rotational momentum around the center of the mass before the
collision, we can use this to find the rotational momentum around the center of mass
after the collision, and from this we find the angular velocity of the object around
the center of mass.
The rotational momentum around the center of mass is the sum of the rotational
momentum for each of the components—around their common center of mass,
Lcm = Lrod + Lbullet . (16.146)
Before the collision, the rotational momentum of the rod around the center of mass
is 0, since it is not rotating initially. The rotational momentum of the bullet depends
on the position rb,cm of the bullet relative the center of mass:
Lbullet = rb,cm × Mv i = (x b,cm i + yb,cm j) × Mv i = −yb,cm Mv k . (16.147)
Notice that only the y-component of rcm contributes. Since the position of the bullet
is −y, and the position of the center of mass is −y/2, we find that the y-component
of rb,cm is yb,cm = −y − (−y/2)) = −y/2, and

After the collision, the whole object, consisting of the bullet and the rod, is rotating
around the center of mass with a rotational momentum:
L1
cm,z = I z ω . (16.149)
The total moment of inertia is:
I z = Irod,z + Ibullet,z , (16.150)
where both moments of inertia must be around the same axis: The axis going through
the center of mass of the rod-bullet system.
For the rod, the moment of inertia around its own center of mass is given in
Fig. 15.5:
Irod,z,cm = 1
12 M L2 . (16.151)
The axis through the rod-bullet center of mass is a distance s = y/2 from the center
of mass of the rod, which we use in the parallel-axis theorem to find:
Irod,z = Irod,z,cm + M

Ibullet,z = M

16.5 General Rotational Motion
So far we have only addressed motions where the axis of rotation does not change
direction. But Newton’s second law for rotations around a fixed point or around the
center of mass has general applicability, it is also valid in cases where the torque
is not parallel to the angular momentum. Let us address what happens in this case
through two examples.
A Rotating Wheel
Let us assume that you are holding a spinning wheel—such as the wheel of a bike.
You are holding onto a rod through the axis of rotation, and you want to rotate the
axis by applying a pair of forces, F and −F, at the two ends of the rod. Let us find
the motion of the wheel due to the force pair.
The system is illustrated in Fig. 16.27a. Initially, the wheel is rotating with the
angular velocity ω around the x-axis, so that the initial angular momentum around
the origin is:
LO = I ω i , (16.156)
since the object is symmetric around this axis.

Fig. 16.27 a You try to change the rotation axis of a spinning wheel by applying a pair of forces F
and −F at symmetric positions around the center of mass of the wheel. b An illustration of the front
wheel of a bike rolling in the positive z-direction. The wheel is rolling, rotating around the x-axis.
As you lean towards the right, you apply a pair of forces on the axis of the wheel, as illustrated. The
resulting torque acts in the z-direction, causing the angular momentum to tilt towards the z-axis,
rotating the wheel so that the bike turns left
16.5 General Rotational Motion 537
We apply a pair of forces to the axis. A force F1 = −F k is acting at the position
r1 = x i, and a force F2 = F k is acting at the position r2 = −x i. In addition, the
wheel is affected by gravity, W = −mg j, and the axis is supported by two forces
balancing the gravitational force, N1 = N2 = mg/2 j. The gravity and the two
balancing forces have no net torque around the center of mass of the wheel.
What is the net torque around the center of mass of the system? We find:
τ net
cm = r1 × F1 + r2 × F2 = x i × −F k − x i × F k = −2x F j . (16.157)
Newtons’ second law for rotational motion gives:
dLO
dt = τ net
cm = −2x F j . (16.158)
The initial angular momentum is along the x-axis, in the i direction. After a small
time interval Δt, the applied forces will have lead to a small tilting of the spin axis,
but the axis is tilting in the direction of the y-axis, while the forces are applied along
the z-axis. Is this strange? No, this is entirely consistent with the experience you
gain while riding a bike. Consider the motion of the front wheel of your bike. Let us
assume that while you are riding forwards, the wheel is spinning around the x-axis
as illustrated in Fig. 16.27b. If you lean towards the left, you are transferring a pair
of forces to the axis of the wheel. Leaning to the left, you pull up on the negative
side (the side in the negative x-direction), and you push down on the positive side of
the spinning axis. As a result, you apply a torque acting in the backward direction—
along the z-axis on the figure, but backward. The rotational axis will therefore tilt in
this direction, causing the wheel to turn to the left! Leaning on your bike therefore
leads to the front wheel turning, as you surely have experienced while cycling.
A Spinning Top
A spinning top is a common child’s toy. You spin it up by you hand (or by a string
or similar device), and the top starts spinning rapidly, balancing on its bottom tip.
The wheel not only rotates around its axis, in addition, the axis of rotation starts
rotating slowly around the vertical axis. As the spinning wheel spins slower and
slower around its own axis, its rotates faster and faster around the vertical axis. What
is happnening?
Let us make a simplified physical model of the spinning wheel. We consider the
wheel to be a symmetric object rotating around its axis of symmetry with an initial
angular velocity ωs , as illustrated in Fig. 16.28. The spinning wheel is standing on a
tip located on the symmetry axis, and we assume that it rotates approximately without
friction. In addition, the rotation axis of the spinning wheel is rotating slowly, with
an angular velocity Ω, around the vertical z-axis. Can we find a relation between ωs
and Ω?

Fig. 16.28 An illustration of a spinning wheel balancing on the point O. The wheel rotates rapidly
arounds its own axis with the angular velocity ωs , in addition, the axis rotates slowly around the
vertical axis with the angular velocity Ω
We start by analyzing the situation in order to determine the motion of the spinning
top. Its motion is determined by the forces acting on it. The spinning top is affected by
gravity, G, and the normal force, N, as illustrated the free-body diagram in Fig. 16.28.
We apply Newton’s second law for the motion of the center of mass:
∑ Fz = N − Mg = M A z = 0 , (16.159)
where we have assumed that the top does not move in the vertical direction, hence
A z = 0. This means that the normal force is:
N = Mg . (16.160)
We apply Newton’s second law for rotation around the point O—the contact point
for the axis of the spinning top. This point is stationary—it does not move throughout
the motion. We find the net torque around this point at a time when the center of
mass of the spinning wheel is located along the x-axis, at the position
r = R i = Ml sin γ i , (16.161)
where we see that R = l sin γ from Fig. 16.28. The net torque around O is therefore:
τ net
O = 0 × N + r × G︸︷︷︸
=−Mg k
= R i × (−Mg k) = −Mg R (−j) = Mg R j . (16.162)
What is the angular momentum of the spinning top? We notice that there are two
contributions to the angular momentum: The spinning top is rotating around its axis
of symmetry, and the center of mass is moving in a circle around the vertical axis.
We use the general expression for the angular momentum for a rigid body
LO = R × M V︸︷︷︸
=Ωk×R
+ Lcm = R MΩ R k + Lcm = M R2Ω k + Icmωs , (16.163)
16.5 General Rotational Motion 539
where we have used that since the spinning top is rotating around its center of mass,
the angular momentum around the center of mass is Lcm = Icmωs , where ωs points
along the axis of the spinning top. In addition, we will now assume that the angular
momentum of the rotation of the center of mass is much smaller than the angular
momentum of the rotation of the spinning mass around its center of mass:
M R2Ω  Icmωs ⇒ f Ω  Icm
M R2 ωs , (16.164)
where the prefactor is of the order one, since the mass is typically located a distance
smaller than R from the center of mass. Consequently, we have assumed that:
Ω  ωs , (16.165)
that the spinning top is rotating much faster around its own axis, than the axis is
rotating around the vertical axis. Our approximation is therefore:
LO  Icmωs . (16.166)
Newton’s second law for angular motion around a fixed point states:
τ net
O = dLO
dt . (16.167)
Now, since we know that the axis of the spinning top is rotating around the vertical
axis with an (approximately) constant angular velocity, we know the change in angu-
lar momentum around the center of mass over a small time step Δt—it is simply
found by the change in the angular momentum vector L0 , which is (approximately)
parallel to the angular momentum around the center of mass. The change in angular
momentum is:
ΔLO = LO (t + Δt) − LO (t) . (16.168)
From Fig. 16.28, we see that the angular velocity vector ωs , and therefore also the
angular momentum LO , rotates an angle Δφ around the vertical axis during the time
interval Δt. Since the “radius” in this circle is L O sin γ , we see that the change in
angular momentum is approximately equal to the arc length along the circle:
ΔL O = (L O sin γ ) Δφ . (16.169)
We divide by Δt, getting:
ΔL O
Δt = L O sin γ Δφ
Δt = L O sin γ Ω . (16.170)
540 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
From Newton’s second law for rotational motion, we know that
d L O
dt = τ net
O = Mgl sin γ , (16.171)
hence
L O Ω = Mgl , (16.172)
and since L O  Icmωs we find:
Ω = Mgl
L O
 Mgl
Icmωs
. (16.173)
We have found a relation between the angular velocity ωs of the spinning top
around its center of mass, and the angular velocity Ω of the spinning axis around the
vertical axis.
We notice that Ω increases as ωs decreases, which “explains” the behavior of
a spinning top running on the floor: It wobbles faster as the spinning wheel slows
down.
However, when ωs → 0, our assumption that M R2Ω  Icmωs breaks down, and
our theory is no longer valid. Our solution therefore only has limited applicability,
and we should make a rule to always check such assumptions at the end, to find if
we have violated them.
Summary

tum of the system around the center of mass is conserved. This is true also when
the center of mass is moving.
Collisions and conservation laws:
• If the net torque around a fixed point O is zero (or very small) throughout a
collision, then the angular momentum around this point is conserved throughout
the collision.
– If the net torque around the center of mass of a system is zero (or very small)
throughout a collision, then the angular momentum around the center of mass is
conserved throughout the collision—independently of the motion of the center
of mass.

Problems
16.5 Motion of rod during a collision-like process. In this problem we will study
the motion of a thin rod that falls and attaches itself to a hinge. We will look at both
the motion of the center of mass of the rod and how the rotation of the rod changes
in the process.
The moment of inertia of the rod about an axis through the center of mass is
I z,cm = 1
12 M L2 , (16.174)
where M is the mass of the rod, and L its length. We hold the rod horizontally
oriented with one of the ends of the rod a height h directly above a fixed point O
where a hinge is located. We release the rod from rest. You can ignore air resistance
(Fig. 16.29).
(a) What is the velocity of the center of mass v0 of the rod when it has fallen a
distance h? What is the angular velocity ω0 about the center of mass of the rod when
it has fallen this distance?
When the end of the rod hits the hinge in point 0, it attaches itself, and the whole
rod starts rotating about 0. We can view this process of attachment as a collision.
You can assume all movement is in the plane as shown in the figure. You can also
neglect air resistance and any friction in the hinge.
(b) Show that the moment of inertia of the rod about an axis normal to the rod through
the point O is I O,z = M L2/3.
(c) Find the angular velocity of the rod about the point O immediately after the rod
becomes attached. You can assume that the rod doesn’t rotate during the process of
attachment and that the torque from the gravity can be disregarded.
(d) Find the momentum of the rod immediately after the rod becomes attached. Is
the momentum conserved? Explain.

The hinge is spring-loaded and affects the rod with a torque τO,z = −κθ. The
potential energy related to this interaction is U = (1/2) κ θ2 .
(e) Find an expression for the angular acceleration of the rod when it has rotated an
angle θ about the point O.
(f) It is possible to find the angle of the rod as a function of time using numerical
methods, finding an analytical expression is more difficult. We can instead use a
different method to find the maximum angle the rod rotates. Find an equation that
decides the maximum angle θ of the rod. Note that you don’t have to solve this
equation.
(g) After reaching the maximum angle, the rod will change it’s direction of rotation
and swing back. What is the angular velocity, ω2 , of the rod about the point O the
moment the rod is horizontal again? (i.e. when the angle θ is 0.)
(h) What is the velocity, v2 , of the center of mass when the rod is horizontal again?
The moment the rod reaches the horizontal orientation, the hinge in point O
breaks, releasing the rod so it is no longer attached. You can assume the rod is not
affected by any external forces during this process and that the kinetic energy of the
rod is conserved.
(i) Show that the velocity of the cm and the angular velocity about the cm immediately
after the attachment fails is v3 = −(3/4) v0 and ω3,cm = (3/2) (v0/L)
(j) Describe the motion of the rod after the attachment breaks.
(k) How high does the center of mass of the rod reach?
16.6 Collision between a rod and a block. In this problem we will study an impact
between a rod and a small block. The rod is homogeneous with the mass M and length
L. The rod is attached with a frictionless hinge in the point O so it can rotate as shown
in the Fig. 16.30. The block is small compared to the rod. The block has the mass m
and is initially at rest on a frictionless surface. The rod starts from rest at an angle θ0
and is released. The rod hits the block when it is hanging straight down (i.e. when
θ = 0). The rod’s moment of inertia about its center of mass is I cm = M L2/12.
(a) What is the rod’s moment of inertia about the point O?
(b) Find the rod’s kinetic energy as a function of the angle θ. You can disregard air
resistance.

Let us now assume the collision is perfectly inelastic.

after the collision.
16.7 A model of two rods colliding. We will in this problem look at a collision
of two long and thin rods. This could for example be a model of how two long
and linear molecules collide. The two rods are identical and remain stuck together
after the collision. Each rod has a mass M and length L. For each rod the moment of
inertia about its center of mass is I0 = M L2/12. The rods are gliding on a horizontal,
frictionless surface as illustrated in Fig. 16.31.
The rods are parallel before the collision. One of the rods is at rest, while the
other has the velocity v0 . After the collision they stick together like one rigid body,
as illustrated in the figure. The starting position is characterized by the distance d as
in the figure. You can neglect the width and height of the rods.
(a) Show that the moment of inertia around the center of mass for the body of the
two rods stuck together is I = (M/2) (d2 + L2/3)
First assume d = 0.
(b) Find the velocity v1 of the center of mass of the system after the collision.

stuck together after the collision? Justify your answer.
Let us now look at the case 0 ≤ d ≤ L.

16.8 Studying friction on a wheel. In this problem we will study the behavior of a
spinning wheel that is lowered onto a flat, horizontal surface. The wheel has a mass
m, a radius R, and a moment of inertia about its center of mass I . We let the x-axis
be parallel with the surface and choose the direction of rotation to be positive in the
clockwise direction, as illustrated in the figure. The coefficient of dynamic friction
between the surface and the wheel is μ. The acceleration of gravity is g. The wheel
is lowered onto the surface at a time t = 0s at the position x(0) = x0 = 0. The
initial velocity of the wheel is v(0) = v0 = 0 and the initial angular velocity is ω0
(Fig. 16.32).
16.9 Tarzan’s swing. Tarzan jumps from a cliff and grabs a vine. He jumps hor-
izontally from the cliff with initial velocity v0 at the time t0 . The vine has mass
M and length L. Initially, the vine is hanging straight down and is attached at its
highest point, O. Tarzan jumps from a height h above the lowest point on the vine,
as illustrated in Fig. 16.33. After the “collision” Tarzan remains attached to the vine,

16.10 Rolling up a slope. In this problem we study the motion of the rotating
wheel placed on a slope. The wheel has mass M and radius R. The wheel consists
of three homogeneous cylinders rotating around the same axis. The middle cylinder
has radius R and mass M/2. A cylinder with radius R/2 and mass M/4 is glued
on each side of the middle cylinder, as shown in Fig. 16.34. The moment of inertia
around the symmetry axis for a cylinder of mass m and radius r is I = (1/2)mr2 .
(a) Show that the moment of inertia around the z axis for the wheel is I =
(5/16)M R2 .
The wheel starts with an angular velocity ω0 and is placed on a slope as shown in
Fig. 16.34, where the positive rotational direction is shown. The wheel starts without

μ. The slope makes an angle θ with the horizontal. You can neglect air resistance.
(b) Draw a free-body diagram for the wheel and name the forces acting on it.
(c) Show that the acceleration of the center of mass of the wheel in the x-direction
becomes a x = g (μ cos θ − sin θ).
You can assume that μ cos θ − sin θ > 0. In the following, we will only study the
motion of the wheel before it starts rolling without slipping. You can assume that the
wheel is moving upward until it starts rolling.

Projects
16.11 Snow crystal In this project you will apply your knowledge of linear and
angular momentum to study the aggregation of small droplets of ice to form large
grains of snow.
As snow crystals form in clouds they start falling through the cloud. Due to air
resistance, larger particles fall faster than smaller particles. A large particle will there-
fore overtake smaller particles. When a smaller particle is overtaken, it will stick to the
larger particle, adding further to the size. This process forms aggregate snowflakes,
which is one of the most common types of snowflakes. 3 This mechanism is often
called differential sedimentation, and is a process important for pattern formation in
many natural systems, and it is also a process important for many industrial processes.
An example of a complex aggregate formed by a related aggregation process called
Diffusion Limited Aggregation in Fig. 16.35 shows the complex geometries typically
found in aggregate grains.
In this project, we will study the aggregation process in detail. We will study an
approximately spherical grain of ice of mass M and radius R, hitting and sticking to
an identical grain of ice.
First, let us address why large particles fall faster than small particles. The mass
of an ice grain of radius R and mass density ρm is
M = ρm
4π
3 R3 . (16.175)
3 You can learn more about this process, and look at how aggregate flakes look in the Ph.D. thesis
of Christopher David Westbrook at http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/sws04cdw/thesis.pdf.

We will assume that air resistance can be modelled using the approximation:
Fv = −k vv , (16.176)
where
k v  20.4Rη (16.177)
is a constant depending on the viscocity η of the fluid.

where g = −gj and g is the acceleration of gravity. Can you now explain why larger
grains fall faster than smaller grains?
We will now study a collision between two identical ice grains. One grain is at
rest relative to the reference system and the other grain has a velocity v0 downwards.
When the two grains collide, they stick together at the point of contact, and remain
stuck together. We call this combination of two grains a compound grain.

moving, and the top grain is moving downwards with a velocity v0 as illustrated. In a the top grain
hits at the top of the stationary grain, and in b the top grain hits the lower grain when the angle
between the line connecting the centers of the grains and the horizontal is θ
(c) The moment of inertia of one ice grain around its center is I c = 2
5 M R2 . Show that
the moment of inertia, I , around the center of mass for a compound grain consisting
of two grains sticking together is I = (14/5) M R2
First, we consider a linear collision where the upper grain hits the lower grain
directly in the center, as illustrated in Fig. 16.36a. We assume the collision to be
instantaneous, so you can ignore the effect of air resistance and gravity during the
collision.
(d) What is the velocity, v1 , of the center of mass the compound grain after the
collision?
(e) What is the angular velocity, ω1 , around the center of mass of the compound
grain after the collision?
Let us now consider the more general case illustrated in Fig. 16.36b. When the
two grains touch, the line between the centers of the two grains forms the angle θ
with the horizontal. The upper grain still has the initial velocity v0 downwards before
the collision, and the lower grain is at rest.
(f) What is the velocity, v1 , of the center of mass of the compound grain after the
collision?
(g) What is the angular velocity, ω1 , around the center of mass of the compound
grain after the collision?
(h) What is the loss of energy in the collision?
Let us now address the motion of the compound grain after the collision. Initially,
it is rotating with the angular velocity ω1 .
(i) If we ignore air resistance, find ω(t) as a function of time for the subsequent
motion.
In the following we will not ignore air resistance, but rather develop a simplified
model for the air resistance. In order to determine the force acting on the compound
object due to air resistance, we either need to perform experiments on such objects,
550 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies
or we can use numerical simulations of the fluid flow around the object to determine
the forces.
Here, we will use a strong simplification: We assume that we may consider the
compound object to consist of two separate spheres. The force on each of the spheres
due to air resistance is described by (16.176), where the corresponding velocity, v,
in (16.176) is the velocity of the center of the sphere, and the force acts in the center
of the sphere.
The compound object has velocity vcm and angular velocity ω.
(j) Argue that the velocities, vA and vB , of each of the ice grains A and B are
vA = vcm + ω × r and vB = vcm − ω × r, where r describes the position of grain
A relative to the center of mass of the compound grain.
(k) Show that the net force on the center of mass of the compound object is ∑ F =
2Mg − 2k vvcm , where g = −gj and g is the acceleration of gravity.
(l) Show that the torque around the center of mass of the compound object due to air
resistance is τ = −2k vωR2 (Hint: Use Lagrange’s formula).
(m) Show that the angular acceleration α of the compound object around its center of
mass can be written as α = dω/dt = −(1/t0)ω, and find the characteristic time t0 .
(n) Describe (with words) the motion of the compound object.
(o) Sketch the time development of the velocity vcm and the angular velocity ω of
the compound object, and discuss how the behavior would change if you changed
the radius, R, of the grains.
(p) How would our argument change if we instead studied large particles, where the
air resistance force depends on the square of the velocity?
Final comment: Notice that the result above for the net force on the compound
grain indicates that small and large grains have the same acceleration, which is not
consistent with our initial result. This is due to our (incorrect) simplification of adding
the air resistance force for each of the grains together to get the air resistance force for
the compound grain. For a real ice crystal formed by aggregation, the dependence
of the air resistance on the size of the compound grain is more complicated, and
will also depend on the complex geometry attained by a compound grain after a few
hundred collisions with smaller grains.
16.12 Collision with rotation. In this project we address a collision between two
identical atoms. You will learn how to determine external and internal motion of
a diatomic molecule after a collision using a combination of analytical techniques,
such as conservation laws, and numerical methods to determine the motion of the
molecule.
We want to address a collision between two identical atoms of mass m, and we
assume that we may consider the atoms to be point particles. The atoms are not
affected by any external forces.
Here, we will first analyze a simplified model for the collision—a one dimensional
model—before we analyze the full collision process.
First, we address a simplified model. The system we consider consists of two
atoms: atom A moves along the x-axis with the velocity v0 , and atom B is at rest in
16.5 General Rotational Motion 551

simplified collision model:
Atoms A and B collide on
the x-axis
the origin as illustrated in Fig. 16.37. The atoms do not interact before they hit each
other. After the collision they are stuck to each other.
(a) Find the velocity of the center of mass for the system before the collision.
(b) Find the velocity of the center of mass of the system after the collision.
(c) What is the change in the system’s kinetic energy through the collision.
Let us make the model slightly more realstic by introducing a simplified model
for the interactions between the two atoms. We will here not use a full model for
the interatomic interaction, but instead assume that we can model the interatomic
interaction using a spring force model. When atom A reaches a distance b from atom
B, the two atoms become attached by a massless spring with spring constant k and
equilibrium length b. The atoms remain attached with this spring throughout the
collision and the subsequent motion.
(d) What is the velcoity of the center of mass immediately after the atoms are attached
with the spring, that is, when atom A is at the distance b from atom B? What is the
change in kinetic energy for the system before and immediately after the collision?
Let us now address the motion of the atoms after the attachment. The positions
of the atoms are x A and x B .
(e) Show that the force on atom A is: F = k((x A − x B )−b), and find a corresponding
expression for the force on atom B.
(f) Find expressions for the acceleration for atom A and B, and formulate the dif-
ferential equations you need to solve to find the motion of the atoms, including the
initial conditions.
(g) Write a program to determine the positions and velocities of atom A and atom B
as a function of time. Assume m = 0.1, k = 20, b = 0.2, v0 = 1.0, and Δt = 0.001.
(h) Plot the position as a function of time for the center of mass of the system and
for each of the atoms.
(i) What is the maximum distance between the two atoms?
The collision we have addressed so far is a special case—the case of a central
colilsion. Let us now address a non-central collision.
First, we address a simplified model for a non-central collision, as illustrated in
Fig. 16.38. Atom A moves in the x-direction along the line y = b with velocity v0 ,
and atom B is at rest at the origin. The atoms do not interacti until they hit each

Atoms A and B collide in a

other, which occurs when atom A reaches x = 0. After the collision, the atoms form
a diatomic molecule, and the atoms remain attached at a fixed distance b from each
other. (We are not studying a model without the spring force, but with a non-central
collision. We will add the spring force again further on to get a complete, but still
simplified model).
(j) What is the velocity of the center of mass and the angular velocity around the
center of mass immediately after the collision?
Let us now introduce a more advanced model for this collision: When atom A is
in the position x = 0, y = b, and atom B is in the position x = 0 and y = 0, the two
atoms become attached with a massless spring with spring constant k and equilibrium
length b. The atoms remain attached throughouth the subsequent motion.
(k) Rewrite your program to model the motion of the atoms in this case.
(l) Plot the motion of the atoms and the center of mass after the collision.
(m) Discuss the motion of the angular velocity for the rotation about the center of
mass for the motion after the collision.
16.13 Modelling a Bouncing Ball. In this project we will study a ball that bounces
on a flat surface. We will only look at a single collision between the ball and the
surface, but we will use different models for the interactions during the collision.
Both the ball and the surface are deformed during the collision, but you can
assume that this deformation is small, this means that the forces from the surface on
the ball will only act in a single point on the ball throughout the collision, and that
the distance from this point to the center of mass of the ball does not change. The ball
slips against the surface during the collision and the coefficient of dynamic friction
between the ball and the surface is the constant μ. You can neglect air resistance.
The ball has a mass m and a radius R, the acceleration of gravity is g, the moment
of inertia of the ball about its center of mass is I .
You throw the ball from a height h with only a horizontal velocity. The velocity
immediately before the collision with the surface is v(t0) = v0x i + v0y j, where v0x
is positive and v0y is negative.
(a) Draw a free-body diagram for the ball while it is in contact with the surface.
Identify the forces.
16.5 General Rotational Motion 553
Let us first assume that the normal force from the surface on the ball is constant, N0 .
(b) Find the vertical component of the velocity, v y (t), and the vertical position, y(t),
of the ball while it is in contact with the surface.
(c) How long is the ball in contact with the surface?
(d) Find the horizontal component of the velocity of the ball as a function of time,
v x (t), while it is in contact with the surface. What is the horizontal component of the
velocity of the ball, v1x , immediately after the collision?
(e) Find the angular velocity as a function of time, ω(t), as well as the angular
velocity, ω1 , of the ball immediately after the collision. Describe the motion of the
ball after the collision.
(f) Is the energy of the ball conserved during the collision? Does the ball bounce
back to the height h after the collision? Justify your answers.
Now assume that the force from the surface on the ball is N = k(R − y)3/2 when
the ball is in contact with the surface, i.e. when y < R.
(g) Find expressions for the accelerations a x and a y of the ball while it is in contact
with the surface.
(h) Find an expression for the angular acceleration a z of the ball while it is in contact
with the ground.
(i) Write a program that finds the motion of the ball’s centre of mass as a function of
time.
(j) Use your program to plot the motion and the velocities of the ball as a function of
time from t = 0s to t = 1s when the ball has a radius of R = 0.15 m and is released
from a height h = 1 m with an initial velocity v0x = 3 m/s. The spring constant is
k = 10,000 N/m, the dynamic friction is μ = 0.3, the mass of the ball m = 1 kg,
the acceleration of gravity g = 9.8 m/s 2 , and the moment of inertia I = (2/3) kgm 2 .
Use a timestep of dt = 0.001 s.

material in the book.
A.1 Derivation of Formula for Two-Particle, Linear Elastic
Collision
Let us study a collision between two objects—drawn as carts in Fig. A.1—where cart
A has mass m A and initial velocity v A,0 , and cart be has mass m B and initial velocity
v B,0 . In this case, we assume that cart B starts at rest, v B,0 = 0. However, we can
address any problem like this, since we can always place our coordinate system so
that it follows the motion of cart B before the collision. We assume that there are no
external forces acting on either cart during the collision—only internal forces acting
between the cart.
Since there are no external forces acting, the total translational momentum, Px ,
is conserved in the x-direction. The translational momentum is:
P = p A + p B = m A v A + m B v B . (A.1)
The momentum is conserved throughout the collision, and it is therefore the same at
the time t0 before the collision and the time t1 after the collision:
P0 = m A v A,0 + m B v B,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 = P1 , (A.2)
where we simplify by introducing v B,0 = 0m/s, allowing us to rewrite (A.2) to:
m A
(v A,0 − v A,1
) = m B v B,1 . (A.3)

This equation represents the conservation of momentum, and is true as long as the
net external force is zero. We consider v A,0 a know quantity. Then we are left with
two unknowns v A,1 and v B,1 . But we only have one equation. We do not know how
the momentum is distributed between the two carts.
Now, if we assume that the collision is elastic, that is, that the mechanical energy
is conserved throughout the collision, we can introduce an addition equation. This
assumption means that we assume that the internal forces acting between the two
carts are conservative, which is an additional assumption compared to what we did
above. In this case, we can an additional equation for the conservation of mechanical
energy:

A,0 + 1
2 m B v2
B,0 = 1
2 m A v2
A,1 + 1
2 m B v2
B,1 . (A.4)
We now solve these two equations ((A.2) and (A.4)) to find v A,1 and v B,1 . We start
by rewriting (A.4) to:
m A
(
v2
A,0 − v2
A,1
)
= m B v2
B,1 . (A.5)
which can also be written as:
m A
(v A,0 − v A,1
) (v A,0 + v A,1
) = m B v2
B,1 . (A.6)
We divide (A.6) by (A.3), getting:
v A,0 + v A,1 = v B,1 , (A.7)
and we insert this for v B,1 in (A.3):
m A
(v A,0 − v A,1
) = m B
(v A,0 + v A,1
) , (A.8)
We solve for v A,1 :
m A v A,0 − m A v A,1 = m B v A,0 + m B v A,1 ⇒ m A − m B
m A + m B
v A,0 = v A,1 , (A.9)
Appendix A: Proofs 557
We insert the result for v A,1 into (A.3), and find:
m A
(v A,0 − v A,1
) = m B v B,1 ⇒ m A
(
1 − m A − m B
m A + m B
)
v A,0 = m B v B,1 , (A.10)
v B,1 = 2m A
m A + m B
v A,0 . (A.11)
This proves the solutions provided in (12.67).
A.2 Derivation of Formula for Two-Particle, Linear
Collisions
Let us address a general collision, elastic, inelastic, and perfectly inelastic, charac-
terized by a coefficient of restitution r.
The coefficient of restitution is defined as the ratio of the relative velocities after
the collision to the relative velocities before the collision:
r = − v A,1 − v B,1
v A,0 − v B,0
. (A.12)
The case r = 1 corresponds to an elastic collision, r = 0 corresponds to a perfectly
inelastic collision, and the case 0 < r < 1 corresponds to an inelastic collision.
From (A.12), the velocity of object B after the collision is:
v B,1 = v A,1 + r (v A,0 − v B,0
) , (A.13)
which we combine with conservation of momentum:
m A v A,0 + m B v B,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 , (A.14)
to get:
m A v A,0 + m B v B,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v A,1 + rm B
(v A,0 − v B,0
) . (A.15)
We solve for v A,1 , finding:
v A,1 = (m A − rm B ) v A,0 + (1 + r) m B v B,0
m A + m B
. (A.16)
We find the velocity of object B in exactly the same way, or simply by exchanging
the indexes for A and B:
558 Appendix A: Proofs
v B,1 = (m B − rm A) v B,0 + (1 + r) m A v A,0
m A + m B
. (A.17)
These are the completely general solutions to the collision problem, including the
special cases of an elastic collision (r = 1) and a perfectly inelastic collision (r = 0).

We divide the motion into the motion of the center of mass of the system and the
motion relative to the center of mass:
ri = R + rcm,i , vi = V + vcm,i . (A.19)
We insert this into the total kinetic energy of the system:
K =

This proves that the kinetic energy can be subdivided into the kinetic energy of the

to the center of mass.

A.4 Proof of the Superposition Principle
The proof of the superposition principle follows directly from the definition of the
moment of inertia: The moment of inertia of a system consisting of both system A
and system B around the axis O is:
I O = ∑
j
m i ρ2
i , (A.21)
where the sum is over all particles in object A and all particles in object B. We can
split this sum into two parts: One sum of all the particles in object A and one sum
over all the particles in object B:
I O =

j=1

which is a proof of the superposition principle.
A.5 Proof of the Parallel-Axis Theorem:
The moment of inertia of an object around the axis A is:
I A = ∑
i
m i ρ2
A,i , (A.23)
where ρA,i is the distance from a point i to the axis. Since the vector s points from
axis A to axis C through the center of mass, we can write the vector from axis A to
point i as (see Fig. A.2):
ρ A,i = s + ρC,i , (A.24)
where ρC,i is a vector from axis C to point i. We insert this into the sum in (A.23):

parallel to the axis C through the center of mass. The vector s is perpendicular to both axes, and
points from the origin of axis C to the origin of axis A
Here we have used that the position of the center of mass in the center of mass system
is zero, hence ∑

A.6 Rotational Momentum and Newton’s Second Law
for a Point Particle
The angular momentum of the point particle with mass m, velocity v, and position,
r is defined as:
l = r × p = r × mv . (A.26)
We find Newton’s second law by taking the time derivative of this equation:

where we have used that dr/dt = v is parallel to p and that the cross-product v × p
is zero. This gives Newton’s second law for a point particle on an alternative form:
dl
dt = ∑
j
r × F j , (A.28)
where all the forces are acting in the point r, since the point particles does not have
any physical extent.
Appendix A: Proofs 561
A.7 Rotational Momentum of a Multiparticle System
From the momentum pi of a particle i, we introduced the total momentum,
P = ∑
i
pi , (A.29)
of a multiparticle system. This allowed us to formulate a generalized version of New-
ton’s second law for translational motion. Similarly, we can introduce the rotational
momentum of a system of particles, simple as the sum of the rotational momentum
of each particle. Particle i is in position ri relative to the origin, hence the rotational
momentum of particle i is:
li = ri × m i vi , (A.30)
and the total rotational momentum of a system of particles around a point O, the
origin, is defined as:
LO = ∑
i
li = ∑
i
ri × m i vi . (A.31)
A.8 Newton’s Second Law for Rotation Around a Fixed Axis
Since we have alread found that for a single point particle, Newton’s second law can
be written as
dli
dt = τ i , (A.32)
we can try to find a similar relation for a multiparticle system. We start from the
definition of the total angular momentum LO :

and take the time derivative on both sides:

562 Appendix A: Proofs
Here, the net force on part i is the sum of the external forces acting on part i and
the internal forces. An internal force must originate in one of the other parts of the
system. We can therefore write all the internal forces as: F j,i , meaning the force from
part j on part i. The net force on part i is therefore:
Fnet
i = Fext
i + ∑
j =i
F j,i , (A.35)
which we insert into the equations, getting:

⎠ =

N∑
i=1
∑
j =i
ri × F j,i . (A.36)
Let us look at the last term, which is the sum of the torques on part i from all parts j
in the system. From Newton’s third law, we know that F j,i = −Fi, j . Therefore, we
rewrite the equation so that we explicitely include action/reaction terms. We do this
through a “trick” you will often meet in physics: We realize that the sum over all the
internal torques:
N∑
i=1
∑
j =i
ri × F j,i , (A.37)
is a sum over all pairs, i, j, so that i  = j. We could also write this as:
N∑
i=1
∑
j =i
ri × F j,i = ∑
i, j:i = j
ri × F j,i , (A.38)
where the last sum is over all possible values of i and j as long as they are not equal.
However, in this sum, there are pairs of torques that are related by action/reaction
forces. There is a torque on particle i due to the force F j,i from particle j on particle
i, but there is also a torque on particle j due to the force Fi, j from particle i on
particle j. If we want to include both of these terms explicitely in the sum, the sum
must only be over half of the i and j values so that we do not include any term twice.
We ensure this by summing over all pairs i and j so that i < j:
∑
i, j:i = j
ri × F j,i = ∑
i, j:i< j
(ri × F j,i + r j × Fi, j
) . (A.39)
Appendix A: Proofs 563
We now use that F j,i = −Fi, j :
∑
i, j:i< j
(ri × F j,i + r j × Fi, j
) = ∑
i, j:i< j
(ri × F j,i + r j × (−F j,i
))
= ∑
i, j:i< j
(ri − r j
) × F j,i . (A.40)
Hmmm. What can we do about this sum? We realize that if the force on particle i
from particle j acts along the line between particle i and j:
F j,i = C j,i
(ri − r j
) , (A.41)
then the last term in (A.40) is zero. We call such forces central forces. In a rigid
body, we assume that all forces are central. However, in many other types of systems
the forces are also central. For example, gravitational forces, typical two-particle
interatomic forces (given by a two-particle potential energy), and electro-static forces
are central forces: This means that many forces from the atomic to the galactic scale
are indeed central forces. It is therefore a reasonable assumption to assume that the
forces are central forces, and that the sum of internal torques is zero.
The rate of change of the total angular momentum of the system is therefore equal
to the net external torque on the system:
dLO
dt =
N∑
i=1
ri × Fext
i = τ ext , (A.42)
which is what we call the net external torque around the point O.
A.9 Rotational Momentum of a Ridig Body
We have now found a general formulation for Newton’s second law for rotational
motion of a multiparticle system. However, we are often interested in rigid bodies.
Can we simplify the relation by first finding the rotational momentum LO , of a rigid
body rotating around a fixed axis, and then use this to find a simplified expression
for Newton’s second law for rotation of rigid bodies?
First, we find the rotational momentum of a rigid body. Figure A.3 shows a rigid
body rotating around the z-axis with an angular velocity ω = ω k. The rigid body
consists of a set of mass point, m i , located at positions ri . The rotational momentum
of this system is then:
LO = ∑
i
li = ∑
i
ri × m i vi . (A.43)

Since the rigid body is rotating with angular velocity ω, the velocity of point i at ri is
vi = ω × ri , (A.44)
where we can decompose the position ri using a cylidrical coordinate system with
a radius vector, ρ = ρ ˆuρ , from the z-axis and out to the point ri and a coordinate z i
along the z-axis:
ri = ρi + z i k . (A.45)
We insert this into the expression for li , getting:
li = ri × (ω × ri ) = ri × (ωk × (ρi + z i k)) , (A.46)
where we notice that the z i k term is parallel to ωk, and therefore this part of the
cross product is zero, giving:
li = ri ×
⎛
⎝ω × ρi + ω × z i k
︸ ︷︷ ︸
=0
⎞
⎠ = ri × (ω × ρi ) . (A.47)
We use Lagrange’s formula for the cross product:
a × (b × c) = b (a · c) − c (a · b) , (A.48)
getting:
li = m i (ω (r · ρ) − ρ (r · ω)) = m i (ω ((ρ + z k) · ρ) − ρ ((ρ + z k) · ω))
= m i
(
ρ2
i ω − ωz i ρi

. (A.49)

The total rotational momentum around the point O is therefore:

Notice the second part of this equation. This term will be zero if the object is rota-
tionally symmetric around the rotation axis. Otherwise, we will need to include this
term.
However, if we are only interested in the z-component of the total rotational
momentum of a rigid body, then we get a simplified result:

(A.51)
Although we must be careful with this expression, because it is tempting to gener-
alize it to a vector equations, which we found above is only correct if the object is
rotationally symmetric around the rotation axis.
A.10 Subdivision of Rotational Momentum
The total rotational momentum LO around a fixed point O can be decomposed into
the rotational momentum of the center of mass moving as a point particle relative to
O and the rotational momentum relative to the center of mass:

We decompose the position of mass m i into:

relative to the center of mass. Inserted into (A.53), we get:

A.11 Newton’s Second Law for Rotation Around the Center
of Mass
We can always describe the motion of a particle i in a multiparticle system as:
ri = R + rcm,i , (A.56)
where R is the position of the center of mass, and rcm,i is the position of the particle
relative to the center of mass, as illustrated in Fig. A.4.
Similarly, we may split the total rotational momentum of a system into the rota-
tional momentum of the center of mass, and the rotational momentum relative to the
center of mass:
LO =
N∑
i=1
li =
N∑
i=1
ri × m i vi , (A.57)
where we now introduce ri = R + rcm,i and vi = V + vcm,i :

The first term is the rotational momentum of the center of mass motion around the
axis O, the second term is the rotational momentum of the object relative to the
center of mass:
Lcm =
N∑
i=1
rcm,i × pcm,i . (A.59)
Let us now use Newton’s second law for rotations of multiparticle systems to find
out what determines the change in rotational momentum around the center of mass.
568 Appendix A: Proofs
From Newton’s second law for rotations, we know that the rotational momentum
and torque around the fixed point O are related by:
dLO
dt = τ O =
N∑
i=1
ri × Fext
i , (A.60)
First, we insert the result for the rotational momentum to determine what is on the
left hand side:
d
dt LO = d
dt (R × P + Lcm) = dR
dt × P + R × dP
dt + Lcm
dt
= V × MV︸ ︷︷ ︸
=0
+R × Fext + Lcm
dt = R × Fext + Lcm
dt . (A.61)
Second, we rewrite the right-hand side of (A.60) by introducing the center of mass
coordinates:
ri = R + rcm,i , (A.62)
We can therefore rewrite
τ O =
N∑
i=1
ri × Fext
i =
N∑
i=1
(R + rcm,i
) × Fext
i =
N∑
i=1

Fext

N∑
i=1
rcm,i × Fext
i = R × Fext +
N∑
i=1
rcm,i × Fext
i , (A.63)
where we have introduce the net external force as:
Fext =
N∑
i=1
Fext
i . (A.64)
We insert this result and the result from (A.61) into (A.60), getting:
dLO
dt = τ O R × Fext + Lcm
dt = R × Fext +
N∑
i=1
rcm,i × Fext
i
Lcm
dt
=
N∑
i=1
rcm,i × Fext
i
Lcm
dt = τ cm , (A.65)
Appendix A: Proofs 569
where we have introduced:
τ cm =
N∑
i=1
rcm,i × Fext
i , (A.66)
as the torque around the center of mass.
We have therefore proven Newton’s second law for rotational motion around the
center of mass:
dLcm
dt = τ cm . (A.67)
We notice that in this derivation we have not assumed anything about the motion of
the center of mass—it can be accelerated or executing any type of motion—the law
is still valid!
