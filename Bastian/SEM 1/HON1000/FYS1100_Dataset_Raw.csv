PrefaceThis book was developed as a textbook for use in the course “Introduction toMechanics” in the Department of Physics at the University of Oslo starting 2007
" Inthis course we aimed at providing a seamless integration of analytical and numericalmethods when solving physics problems, thereby allowing us to solve moreadvanced and applied problems in mechanics, and providing examples that areperceived as more relevant for the students"
" We could address not only the veryspecial cases that have analytical solutions, but could instead focus on choosingproblems that would initiate discussions and provide the students with physicalinsights"
"Through the processes of introducing and developing advanced problems, it alsobecame clear that this approach brought the students closer to the way physics isdiscovered and applied"
" In addition, it introduced the students to a more exploratoryway of understanding phenomena and of developing their physical concepts"
 Well-developed examples that also include elements of numerical computations gave thestudents a feeling of discovering physical processes while also understanding howthey are results of the underlying simple physical laws
" In many cases, the advancedexamples and exercises spawned interesting and rewarding discussions about theunderlying physical processes, and also forced the students to understand thevarious forms of representation used to illustrate physical processes, such as motiondiagrams and energy diagrams, and use these diagrams to reason about physicalprocesses"
"As the course, examples, and exercises were developed it also became clear thatthe introduction of numerical methods in an introductory course in physics alsohelped build the notion that numerical methods are no different from analyticalmethods—they are part of the theoretical toolbox that any physicist is supposed tomaster"
" Our aim became to make it as natural for our students to solve theirproblems by developing a small program and discussing the results, as it was to usea calculator"
"It has been particularly rewarding to observe the way that many of the examplesand exercises trigger discussions when students discover unexpected results, in theform of unexpected resonances in a simple model for friction or in the case ofviiGreenwood gaps in the distribution of asteroids in the solar system"
 The insight thatthe simple laws of mechanics that they learned actually had observable conse-quences and explanatory power was often an important insight as well as animportant reinforcer for the students
 We also believe that this helps the studentbuild a more realistic image of how science actually is done
"In order to get most of the numerical parts of this text it is advantageous for thestudents to have some prior knowledge of scientific programming, preferably with ascripting type language such as Matlab or Python, but this is not absolutely nec-essary"
 We encourage readers who are not familiar with scripting type programmingfirst to study Chap

Oslo Anders Malthe-SørenssenMarch 2015Chapter 1IntroductionIn this book we introduce the fundamental concepts in our understanding of natureand learn to use them to deepen your understanding of nature
 This is a bold andsweeping goal—it is indeed the goal of physics
 The tools and concepts from mechan-ics have a central role in how a physicist thinks about nature
 And an important partof learning mechanics is to learn to think like a physicist
 Unfortunately there are noshort-cuts to acquiring the experience of an expert
" The only way to learn physics,and mechanics, is through diligent application of the theory to example and exer-cises"
" We will help you by providing hints on how to structure your approach, byintroducing well-tested problem solving techniques, and through worked examples,but in the end it is only the amount of work you spend on exercises that will determineyour success"
" The examples also provide you with inspirations for what you can dowhen you master the basic principles of mechanics, and we hope this will indeedshow you the power that lies in our knowledge of physics, and the exiting adventureit is to discover how nature works and apply that knowledge to develop technologiesfor the best of mankind"

1 PhysicsPhysics has several aspects: Physics as a science represents the quest to understand thebasic laws of nature
 Physics provides the tools to understand the processes occurringin nature on all time and length scales
 Physics also provides the conceptual andtheoretical background for developing new technologies
" The fashionable directionsin technological and scientific development change, but they all depend on a solidfoundation in physics"
 Physics as a scientific venture is an interplay between thedevelopment of theory and experimental investigations
How physics is used to understand nature is clearly expressed in the physics ofbiological processes
 If you are interested in how a protein folds—and how it foldsis important to understand its functions and interactions—we must understand the© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015A
" Malthe-Sørenssen, Elementary Mechanics Using Python,Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics, DOI 10"
"1007/978-3-319-19596-4_112 1 Introductionfundamental physics in the interactions between atoms, between the molecular partsof the protein, and between the protein and the surrounding fluid"
 Physics providesthe tools to develop such an understanding
"Physics provides us with the tools to develop new, better technologies"
 Technolo-gies that can help solve environmental- or energy-related problems
" And physicstempts us with possibilities to develop completely new technologies, based on so-far unknown principles, that may lead to improvements larger than we could haveimagined"
"There are still unsolved, fundamental problems that are within the reach of physics"
"But in order to address these problems you must master the tools of the trade, youmust develop an ability to understand and address the physics of problems, you mustdevelop knowledge about the laws of physics, since we use this knowledge to guideour intuition when we think of physics, and you must develop your knowledge ofmathematical tools so that you can solve real problems"
 This starts with learningmechanics
You will learn beautiful laws in physics
" Much of the theory you learn will beformulated in nice, mathematical equations, beautiful symmetries"
" It is elegant, con-cise, and beautiful"
 And this is indeed something we want to show you
 Nature couldhave been in so many ways
" But, look—it is so simple, and so beautiful"
But try not to be blinded by the beauty
 The most beautiful and elegant mathemat-ical formulations are found in the parts of physics that are finished
 There is not reallyanything left to do but to find new decimals in the physical constants
" When a fieldis under development it is often messy, unfinished, unready"
 It is uncharted territorywaiting for someone to make sense of it
 There may be many exiting discoverieswaiting in the messiness
 Such is often the nature of discovery

2 MechanicsMechanics is the part of physics that addresses the motion of objects
" However, inorder to predict motion, we need quantitative tools to describe motion"
 Our main toolis calculus and associated analytical and numerical methods
" The study of motion istraditionally called kinematics, which is in many ways closer to mathematics than tophysics"
 When we approach a problem in physics we first use our physical insight tosimplify the problem
 We strive to make the problem so simple that we can use simplephysical laws to formulate mathematical equations that describe the motion
" The firstpart of this process, finding a good physical model and translating the model into amathematical problem is what we typical refer to as the “physics of the problem”"
"When we have formulated a mathematical description of the problem, we find themotion and solve the problem using methods from our mathematical toolbox, whichcontains both analytical and numerical methods"
" In practice, there is a significantinterplay between finding the right physical formulation and solving the mathematicalproblem, because our insight in physics, and, in particular, in more general concepts1"
"2 Mechanics 3such as conservation laws, often allows us to find short-cuts that lead to an analyticalsolution"
" Although, for many problems, and arguably for almost all applied problems,there will never be a simple, analytical solution, and we must depend on our abilityto address problems using robust, numerical techniques"
In this book we will take you through this procedure many times
 So many timesthat it becomes deeply rooted in you
" And as soon as you have grasped the simplicityof the method, we hope you will keep it a secret—physics is supposed to be difficult,and you are expected to uphold that tradition"

"3 Integrating Numerical MethodsThe most unusual part of this textbook is the integration of numerical and analyticalmethods into the exposition of theory, examples, and exercises"
" What do we mean byanalytical and numerical methods? Analytical methods are the classical mathematicalmethods you have learned to use in calculus, giving you an exact analytical solutionthrough derivation, integration, or the solution of differential equations"
" Numericalmethods are a similar set of tools that you may have learned to use to solve thesame types of problems on a computer: numerical derivation, numerical integrationand numerical solution of differential equations"
 We have developed this integratedapproach because we know that the use of computational methods are going to beimportant for you—probably more important than the use of analytical techniques;because it allows us to present you with more realistic and inspiring examples andapplications; and because it also provides you with a deeper understanding of theunderlying mathematics
The use of computations to solve problems in mathematics and physics is notnew
" For example, when the famous physicist Richard Feynman introduced planetarymotion in his classic lectures at CalTech in 1961, he used a simple numerical schemeto calculate the motion of the planets"
" However, with the advent of the computer wenow have the possibility to do billions of computations per second with ease, and thiscompletely changes the game"
 We can now solve very complicated problems on anycomputer—if we only know how
" The use of computational methods is becomingincreasingly important in most areas in science and engineering, in academia and inindustry"
" Since the ambition of any education is to prepare you for a 40 year workinglife, we know that you need to master the use of computational methods just as well,if not even better, than you master classical analytical methods—since this is whatyou will be using to solve problems"
This text is based on the principle that you learn best what you do every day
"That is why we have integrated the use of numerical methods into every part of thetext—it is part of how we explain the theory, it is part of the examples, and it ispart of the exercises you do"
" However, such an integration requires you to learn aparticular programming language"
" This text comes in two versions, one version basedon Python and one version based on Matlab"
" The text is identical, it is only the parts4 1 Introductiondescribing specifics of the programming languages that are different in the two cases"
"It is an advantage to know some basic scientific programming before reading thistext, but it is not necessary—many students have become proficient at programmingsimply by reading this text, solving the exercises, and discussing with students andtutors"

4 Problems and ExercisesThis book consists of several types of problems and exercises that have variousfunctions:Discussion questions: A classical type of problems in physics are called “Fermi”problems named after Enrico Fermi
 They are mainly estimation problems of complexquestions with many unknowns
 The main point of such a problem is not to identifythe correct answer—there may be none known—the point is the process of reasoningto find an order of magnitude estimation of the answer
 Such problems are well suitedfor a group discussion
 Similar questions have recently become very popular as partof job interviews—since they test how the applicant think and apply her knowledgeand reasoning power to address an unknown problem
"Closed, structured problems: This is the classical physics problem"
" We call theproblem “closed” if all the necessary data is given in the problem, and “structured”if the steps to go from the initial problem to the solution are given as subexercises"
These problems are popular because the teach problem solving by example andpractice by following a structured approach
 The idea is that you will learn to dothis automatically for yourself if you have done it a sufficient number of times in theexercises
"Open, unstructured problems: When you have practice in solving structured andclosed problems, you should be ready for open and unstructured problems"
" In “open”problems, not all necessary details are given—you have to figure out or decide severalkey facts yourself"
 This is the type of problems you will meet in your professionallife
" Students may initially find these problems frustrating, in particular since theyhave to introduce many approximations themselves and evaluate whether they areappropriate"
" However, such problems may also be inspiring, since they allow formore creativity and for more discussions"
"Examples of open, closed, structured, and unstructured problems: An open,unstructured problem could be: “A tank is filled with water from a faucet"
 How longdoes it take to fill the tank?”
" The corresponding closed, unstructured problem wouldbe: “A cylindrical tank of diameter 10 cm and height 20 cm is filled with water at arate of 0"
1dm 3 /s
 How long does it take to fill the tank?”
" The corresponding closed,structured problem would be: “A cylindrical tank of diameter 10 cm and height 20 cmis filled with water at a rate of 0"
1dm 3 /s
 (a) What is the area of the base of the tank? (b)What is the volume of the tank? (c) How long time does it take to fill this volume?”

"4 Problems and Exercises 5Projects: We provide long, structured problems that require the application of bothanalytical and numerical methods"
" In addition, we focus on discussion and evaluationof the results, and evaluation of the approaches and approximation"
 The idea is thatyou will learn the work-flow used in actual research through these project
 Solvingthe projects is considered a major objective of this book
" Indeed, the text is meant togive you the background to solve these problems"

5 How to Learn PhysicsWe actually know quite a lot about how to learn and how to teach physics
" Theresearch area known as Physics Education Research (PER) is well developed, andprovide teaching institutions good insights into what methods work and how theywork"
" This knowledge is important for you, since it gives you a research based insightinto how you can optimize your time and learn physics as efficiently as possible"
"Almost all pedagogical research (on how to learn physics) can be boiled down toa single result: Students learn best when they are deeply involved in doing physics(reading, discussing, solving problems) with material that is adapted to the student,receiving immediate, individualized feedback"
"Learning physics is an active, mental process where you have to construct theknowledge in your own mind"
 Reflecting on how you learn is therefore importantfor your own learning process
 One aim of your education in physics is to be ableto think like an expert
 Experts think about physics using a few general principlesthat are organized in a hierarchy so that they cover all of physics
" Novices tendto think of physics as many, independent results—one for each situation, one foreach problem—which makes learning physics an hopeless endeavor in memorizingformulas"
"The most effective way to learn physics is to have a private, competent tutorwho can adapt the material, provide feedback, individualize explanations, give youproblems that are at the appropriate level of difficulty, monitor your thinking bydiscussions, and help you correct your thinking to learn fruitful mental models"
 Thisis actually the way physics is taught at the graduate level
The second best way is to learn physics in a social setting where you immerseyourself in physics discussions and thinking throughout the day
" Discussions withyour co-students as well as your teachers will guide you, give you feedback on yourthinking, and provide you with direction on how to work"
 But you will have to provideimportant parts of the individualization yourself
" You have to choose how much ofthe textbook you should read, you may have to select problems to solve and usesolution manuals in useful ways, and you are responsible for your own progress"
This is the environment we typically try to create at a college or university

1 Advice for How to Succeed• Everybody can learn physics
 Do not believe otherwise
 Experiments with one-to-one mentoring shows that large improvements can be gained by attending a properlearning regimen
 You can do it—but it will require effort
 Take responsibility foryour own learning
• You learn efficiently by trying to frame your understanding of a problem in words—you learn by discussing physics with other students and your teachers
 It turns outthat it is the one who does the explaining who learns the most
" Asking anotherstudent about something is therefore an important part of learning, but it is actuallythe student you ask who benefits the most—even if it does not feel this way"
" Youshould therefore seek environments where you participate actively in discussingphysics problems: Attend workshops and teaching groups, find a good group ofstudents to work with, use web-forums actively to discuss and formulate yourunderstanding"
" If you participate actively in making a good learning environment,you will benefit from this yourself"
• You learn from getting feedback on your work
" You should therefore grab allchances of getting feedback constructively: Hand in written exercises, demand rel-evant feedback on the exercises, and use this feedback to guide your own teachingprocess: Read based on the feedback and choose problems based on the feedback"
Try again if you fail
• Act as your own coach
 Set your own targets and measure how well you are doingin reaching them
 Prepare for the teaching you participate in
 Reading even just10 min about a subject before attending class will greatly improve your learningoutcome
 Think about how you learn: What parts of the teaching activities do youfind most useful for your learning? What environments help you learn better? Howdo you learn physics?• Multitasking does not work—it is a myth
 Your mind cannot pay attention to morethan one thing at a time
 Trying to do more things at once decreases your overallproductivity
 You should therefore try to work uninterrupted when as you learnnew stuff
• Learning new things “hurts”—you should be able to feel the mental strain as youpush yourself to the limits
 This text and many others provide solution manuals
Do not use them recklessly! You only fool yourself
 Even just glancing at a sketchof a problem can significantly reduce the learning outcome from this problem
"You will not have access to this on the exam, and you will definitely not haveaccess to solutions when you solve real world problems"
" However, you will haveaccess to other examples"
" Learn to use examples in a constructive manner—initiallyas templates for how to think and solve a problem, eventually as an automatedproblem-solving approach that you can apply to any problem"
"• A textbook is a perfect adaptive learning tool, since you can choose for yourselfwhat parts to read, when to read it, and how to read it"
" You can also choose whetheryou want to start by reading, start from the example, or start from the problems"
"Use this flexibility wisely, and reflect on how you use it"

6 How to Use This Book 71
6 How to Use This BookThis textbook is meant to be used as a stand-alone textbook in physics or as a sup-plementary text on numerical methods in introductory physics
" The book is intendedto be read linearly: first you read the text, then your read the examples, and then yousolve the problems"
" However, I realize and even encourage you to choose your ownlearning strategies"
" The most important part is what you do in the form of tutorialsand exercises, and not what you read"
" The text can therefore be seen as supportingmaterial for the projects: In order to be able to do the projects, you need to read thetext and study the examples"
" Still, the book has a certain organization, which is basedon the knowledge that you may take several paths through the text:Background: This text requires a course in calculus"
" It does not require a coursein numerical methods and programming, but experience shows that programmingrequires maturity to master — and an additional course in programming is thereforeuseful to ensure that the methods learned here become integrated into the toolbox ofeach student"
"Numerical methods: The main exposition of the material, the theoretical explana-tion, includes both numerical and analytical methods where they are apt"
" We do notseparate them, since they are equally important"
" However, in addition to the use ofnumerical methods in the main text, we have added addition material on numericalmethods, which is meant to provide a more solid mathematical foundation for theuse of numerical methods"
"Problem-solving strategies: We introduce a few, robust problem-solving strategies"
"These are meant to be general templates that you should become so used to, that youuse them without thinking about it"
" Initially, we therefore suggest that you followthese strategies as closely as possible, but as you get more experienced you may takeshort cuts or automate larger parts of the solution strategies"
" However, if you arebaffled by a problem, you always have the problem-solving strategies to fall backon"
Proofs: Most of the more advanced material and many of the longer derivations andproofs are left out of the text flow
" However, you can find relevant derivations andassociated mathematical theory at the end of the book or online"
Examples: Each concept can be explained by key worked examples
 These are thecentral examples that may serve as templates for how to address a particular classof physical systems
 They are often extended and provide the best background forsolving the projects
Chapter 2Getting Started with ProgrammingIn this text we integrate the use programming techniques and tools in our studyof physics
 You will therefore need to know a few programming basics in order toprofit from this approach
" However, if you do not have a relevant background inintroductory scientific programming, do not despair"
 Experience shows that you canlearn to program through your first physics course—many students have done thissuccessfully and with good results
" In order to prepare you for the main text, thischapter provides an introduction to programming"

1 A Python CalculatorWe are in this text using the editor Spyder to work with Python
 (Alternatively youcan use iPython—type ipython in a terminal window to start)
" When you startSpyder, you get a window where you can type commands to be executed"
" Click onthe Console window in the lower right corner and type:>> 9*436Notice the difference between the text you type, which is preceded by », and theresults generated by the program, which are typeset without indentation"
"Python can be used as an advanced calculator by typing expressions on the com-mand line:>> 3*2**3+428Standard operators are plus (+), minus (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and power(**)"
 Powers of ten are input using e:>> 4

566370614359172Python uses radians for the trigonometric functions:>> sin(pi/6)0
"49999999999999994As you can see, Python does not always round off as you may expect, even thoughthe answer is close to the exact answer (sin(π/6) = 0"
5)
" You can find a list of usefulsyntax, functions and expressions in the summary"
Python becomes more useful when you have a formula you want to use
" Forexample, you may want to use the formula:T F = 95 TC + 32 , (2"
"1)to find the temperature, T F , in Fahrenheit, given the temperature TC in centigrade"
"We may type this formula directly into Python>> TF = 9/5*TC + 32Traceback (most recent call last): File ""<stdin >"""


"NameError: name ""TC"" is not definedOoops"
" That did not work, because Python does not yet know the value of TC "
 Wegive TC a value and retype the formula:>> TC = 40
0>> TF = 9
0/5
0*TC + 32
"0To see the answer, typeprint TF104"
0Note that we are typing 
0 after each number
" This is because Python differs betweenintegers (1, 2, 3, 4, "
 
 
") and real numbers, (1"
"0, 2"
"3, 4"
"9, "
 
 
)
 Typing 
0 or only 
(a dot) after each number ensures that the numbers are real
 Also notice that integerdivision is not the same as real division
" With integer division 9/5 = 1, while withreal numbers 9"
0/5
0 = 1
8
"Instead of retyping the formula, you can use the up arrow to find your previouslytyped commands and execute them again"
" We have now defined a variable, TC"
 Youcan see the value given to TC by typing:>> print TC40Notice that we assigned a value to the variable TF through a calculation
 We havenot introduced a function for TF
" What does this mean? It means that if you changethe value of TC, the value of TF will not change automatically unless you retype2"
1 A Python Calculator 11the formula for TF
" You can check this by assigning TC a new value, and then askPython for the value of TF:>> TC = 50>> print TF104"
0This is an important aspect of a programming language such as Python a variabledoes not change value unless you assign a new value to it!2
"2 Scripts and FunctionsHowever, we do not want to type in the whole formula each time we want to calculatea new value for T F "
" Instead we can make a script, a group of several statements, ora function, similar to an internal function such as sin"
"ScriptsWe can group several statements into a script, which we can reuse"
 You do this byopening a new file in the File menu in Spyder: File → New file



 Thisopens a new window with an editor
 Here you can now type (or copy) the commandswe already used:TC = 40
0TF = 9
0/5
0*TC + 32
"0print TFNow, we need to save the script"
 In the editor window you do: ‘File‘→‘Save‘
 Youmust give the script a name and choose where to place it
 This will generate a filewith an extension 
"py - we call such a file a py-file, because it shows that the filecontains a Python script/program"
 You run the program from the editor window bytyping the F5 key
 A dialog box will show up
 Select Execute in current


", leave all other options as they are and click the Run button"
" As a result thecommands in the script are executed as if they were typed into the Python window,and the resulting output is shown in the Python window:104"
0You can now change the value of TC in the script and rerun the script to redothe calculation for another temperature
 Notice that we wrote the script so that thetemperature TC is assigned inside the script
" This means that if you change the valueof TC on the command line, for example by typing:>> TC = 45"
"0and then run the script—the script will not use this new value of TC, but instead usethe value from inside the script"
12 2 Getting Started with ProgrammingWriting scripts to solve simple problems will be our standard operating procedurethroughout this text
" This is an efficient way to develop a simple program, changethe parameters (such as changing TC), and rerun the program with new parameters"
"While this is practical for developing short programs and solving simple problems,it is not good programming practice"
" In general, we encourage the development ofgood programming practices, but in this text we will prioritize making the code assimple as possible"
"FunctionsFrom a programming perspective, it is better to introduce a function to calculatethe temperature"
 A user defined function acts just like a predefined mathematicalfunction such as sin or exp
 We define a function by opening a new py-file: PushFile → New File 



 We define a function by typing the following into theeditor:def convertF(TC):# Converts from centigrade to FahrenheitTF = 9
0/5
0*TC + 32
0return TFand save it with the name convertF
py
"What do these statements do? We define a function by the command def followedby the name of the function, the input arguments"
" The line must end with a colon, :"
"Here the only argument is the temperature in centigrades, TC"
" Inside the function wemust calculate the value of TF, because this is the value the function is supposed tocalculate"
" Finally, we specify that the function will return the value of the variable TF"
We call our new function by typing:>> convertF(45
0)113
"0Notice that Python requires each such used-defined function to either be in the samefile as the script using the function, of the function must be in a separate file, and thatthe file must be in the search path for Python"
 This means that the file convertF
pymust be in the current directory or in the standard Python directory for this to work
"I suggest that you always save the functions you need in the same directory as yousave the scripts you are currently working on, and that you make new directories foreach problem"
A particular feature of functions is that the internal calculations and variables usedinside the function are lost as soon as the function is finished
" For example, Pythonmay use several calculation steps if we call the sin function, but this is hidden fromus"
" Outside the function, we only see the result of the function"
" To illustrate this, wecould break our short function into several steps:2"
2 Scripts and Functions 13def convertF2(TC):# Converts from centigrade to Fahrenheitratio = 9
0/5
0constant = 32
"0TF = factor*TC + constantreturn TFHere, we have introduced two internal variables, ratio and constant, that areforgotten as soon as the function is finished"
" For example, if we type:>> convertF2(45"
"0)113>> print ratioTraceback (most recent call last): File ""<stdin >"", "


"NameError: name ""ratio"" is not definedwe see that Python does not know the value of ratio after the function has doneits work"
Functions are powerful and necessary tools of more advanced programming tech-niques and will be gradually introduced throughout the text
" But initially we try tomake the programs as simple as possible, and we will therefore use simple scriptingas our main tool"
2
"3 Plotting Data-SetsPython not only works as a numerical calculator, it also has advanced data visu-alization capabilities"
" For example, as part of a laboratory exercise you may havemeasured the volume and mass of a set of steel spheres"
" You number the measure-ments using the index, i, and record masses m i and volumes Vi in Table 2"
"1, wherewe have used that 1 litre = 1 l = 1 dm 3 "
Such a sequence of numbers are stored in an array (or a vector) in Python
 Wedefine the sequence of masses and volumes in Python using>> m = array([1
"0,2"
"0,4"
"0,6"
"0,9"
"0,11"
0])>> V = array([0
"13,0"
"26,0"
"50,0"
"77,1"
"15,1"
36])We can find an individual mass value by:>> print m[0]1
0>> m[3]6
0Table 2

13 l 0
26 l 0
50 l 0
77 l 1
15 l 1
"36 l14 2 Getting Started with ProgrammingThere are now 6 values for the masses, numbered m[0] to m[5]"
" Notice that Pythonstarts enumeration at 0, so that 0 is the first element and 5 is the last element"
 We callthe array m a 6 × 1 array or a vector of length 6
 The volumes are stored the sameway:>> V[0]0
1300>> V[3]0
7700The enumeration of the two arrays is identical: element m[3] of the masses corre-sponds to element V[3] of the volumes
The relation between m and V is illustrated by plotting V as a function of m
" Thisis done by the plot command:>> plot(m,V,’o’)where the string ’o’ ensures that a small circle is plotted at each data-point"
" Theplot command makes a “scatter” plot—it contains a point for each of the data-pointsm(i), V (i) in the two arrays"
 The two arrays must therefore be the same length—theymust have the same number of elements
" We annotate the axes by:>> xlabel(’m (kg)’)>> ylabel(’V (l)’)where the xlabel refers to the first array m in plot(m,V,’o’), and the ylabelrefers to the second array—the V array"
 The resulting plot is shown in Fig
 2
1
Where did the units (kg and liters) go when we defined the mass m and the volumeV? We cannot use units when we introduce digital representations of the numbers
We can only input numbers into Python and we have to keep track of the units
 Thisis why we specified the units along the axes in the xlabel and ylabel commands

4 Plotting a FunctionPython cannot plot a function such as sin(x) directly
" We must first generate twosequences of numbers, one sequence for the x’es and one sequence for the corre-sponding values of sin(x), and then plot the two sequences against each other"
" Whilethis may sound complicated, Python has functions that ensure that you can almostdirectly write the mathematical expression into Python"
"LoopsWe want to make a sequence of x’es, such as 0"
"0, 0"
"1, 0"
"2, 0"
"3, "
 
 
 etc
", and then foreach x i we want to calculate the corresponding value for sin(x i ) in Table 2"
"2, wherewe generate x i from 0"
0 to 10
0 in steps of 0
1
"How do we generate such an array in Python? First, we have to generate the array"
 1How many elements do we need? Going from 0
0 to 10
0 in steps of 0
1 we need:n = 10
0 − 0
00
"1 + 1 , (2"
"2)steps, where we have added one in order to include the last step (otherwise we wouldstop at 9"
9 instead of at 10
0
 We define an array of this length by:>> n = int(ceil((10
0-0
0)/0
"1)+1)>> x = zeros((n,1),float)Here, the function ceil() rounds up"
 Notice the use of int in order to ensurethat we return an integer and not a real
" The function zeros((n,1),float)generates and returns an array of size n by 1 which is filled with zeros"
 Now we needto fill the array:>> x[0] = 0
0>> x[1] = 0
1>> x[2] = 0
2>> x[3] = 0
3>> x[4] = 0
4


1 In Python it is not necessary to define the size of the array before it is filled
" We could just fill it aswe go along, but this is not good coding practice, it will lead to very slow codes for large arrays,and may cause surprising errors in your programs"
 We will therefore always predefine the size ofarrays
"16 2 Getting Started with ProgrammingFortunately, there is a more efficient way of doing this—by using a for-loop"
" Afor-loop allows us to loop through a list of values 0, 1, 2, "
 
 
" , n − 1 for the variablei, and then execute a set of commands at each step—exactly what we need"
 We canreplace the long list of x[0] = 0
0 etc
 by the loop:>> for i in range(n):


 x[i] = i*0
"1If you type this in, nothing will execute until you press Enter twice"
 Note also thatyou need to indent the first line after the colon in the line with the for-statement
 Itis only the set of commands that are indented that are part of the loop and that are runseveral times
 Indenting the line means that you add four spaces to the beginning ofthe line (compared with for in the for-statement)
 Indentation is the way Pythonrecognizes a block of commands
You can check the generated values of x by:>> print x[[ 0
 ][ 0
1][ 0
2][ 0
3][ 0
4][ 0
5]


"Notice how we specify the range of the loop, by specifying a sequence of numbers byuse of the range(n) function"
 Typing range(n) at the command prompt givesyou exactly the list of values for i
 In Python it is important that n is an integer
" Ifwe had not been careful to define n as an integer above, we would have need to doit here by typing range(int(n))"
"Now, let us put this into a small script"
 And let us also calculate the value for thefunction sin(x):from pylab import *x0 = 0
"0, x1 = 10"
"0, dx = 0"
"1n = int(ceil((x1-x0)/dx) + 1)x = zeros((n,1),float)y = zeros((n,1),float)for i in range(n):x[i] = x0 + i*dxy[i] = sin(x[i])plot(x,y)show()Which both generates and plots the function sin(x)"
" The variables x0, x1, and dxprovide the start, stop and step of the x-values used"
 You can now change them andrerun the script to generate plots for other ranges or with other resolutions
Notice that y[i] = sin(x[i]) must appear inside the loop—that is beforethe end
" Otherwise it would only be executed once, using the value i had at the end ofthe loop"
 Putting commands outside a loop that should be inside a loop is a commonmistake—sometimes also done by experienced programmers
2
"4 Plotting a Function 17The While-LoopThe for-loop is probably the loop-structure you will use the most, but there arealso other tools for making a loop, such as the while-loop"
 In the while-loop thecommands inside the loop are executed until the expression in the while commandis true
 It does not automatically update a counter either
" For example, we can changethe script to calculate sin(x) to use a while-loop instead by the following changes:"


"y = zeros((n,1),float)i = 0while i<=n:x[i] = x0 + i*dxy[i] = sin(x[i])i = i + 1"


"Notice that we must assign i=0 before the loop and i=i+1 inside the loop, sincewe now need to update the counter “manually” inside the loop"
 We also introducean “expression” i<=n which may be false (having the value 0) or true (having thevalue 1)
 The loop continues until the expression becomes false
" Notice that a commonsource of error is to generate while loops that continue forever, for example becauseyou have forgotten to update the counter inside the loop"
 You will notice this becauseyour program never ends: Python will never stop or plot your results
"You may wonder what the point of the while-loop is, since it looks more cum-bersome than the for-loop"
 We will use the while loop when we want to continuea calculation for an unknown number of steps
" For example, you may want to findthe motion of a falling ball up to the point where it hits the ground"
" However, youmay not know beforehand how many steps are needed before it hits the ground"
 Ifthe position of the ball is x(t) = 1000 − 4
"9 t2 , we can calculate the position as afunction of time in steps of dt as long as x is positive using the following program:from pylab import *t0 = 0"
"0, t1 = 10"
"0, dt = 0"
"01n = int(ceil((t1-t0)/dt) + 1)t = zeros((n,1),float)y = zeros((n,1),float)t[0] = t0y[0] = 100"
0-4
9*t[0]**2i = 0while y[i]>0
0:i = i + 1t[i] = t0 + i*dty[i] = 100
0-4
"9*t[i]**2#stop1plot(t[0:i],y[0:i])xlabel(’t [s]’); ylabel(’y [m]’);This script needs some explanation"
" First, we notice we update both now is t andy and not only x as before"
" In addition, we see that we calculate the value of y[0]before the loop starts, otherwise the loop would never start"
 This is also a commonmistake
" Therefore, ensure that you understand why and what is done before thewhile-loop starts in this script"
"18 2 Getting Started with ProgrammingVectorizationWhile loops are generally powerful and useful methods, there is a much simpler wayto generate sequences of numbers and plot functions in Python—and the method alsoallows your code to follow the mathematical formulas more closely"
 This method iscalled vectorization
We can make a sequence of x’es in several ways using functions that are built intoPython instead of using a loop
" For example, the function linspace generates asequence of equidistant numbers from 0"
0 to 10
"0:>> x = linspace(0,10,10)>> print x[ 0"

77777778 8
88888889 10
" ]In this case we generated 10 numbers, but you are free to choose your own resolu-tion"
" An alternative to specifying the number of points you want, as we do withlinspace, is to specify the step size"
 The expression r−[0
0:10
0:0
3]returns an array starting at the value 0 and ending at 10
0 in steps of 0

9])Ok—so that was simply an easier way of generating the array x
 Why all the fuzz?Because of a powerful feature of Python called vectorization: we can apply thefunction sin(x) to the whole array x
 Python will then apply the function to each ofthe elements in x and return a new array with the same number of elements as x
"The three lines:>> x = linspace(0,10,10)>> y = sin(x)>> plot(x,y), show()are equivalent to the program:from pylab import *x0 = 0"
0x1 = 10
0dx = 1
"0n = int(ceil((x1-x0)/dx) + 1)x = zeros((n,1),float)y = zeros((n,1),float)for i in range(n):x[i] = x0 + (i-1)*dxy(i) = sin(x[i])plot(x,y)show()2 Notice the small difference between the two methods: using linspace ensures that the first andthe last numbers are included in the list, but when you use arange(0"
"0, 10"
"0, 0"
3) the lastnumber is 9
9 and not 10
0!

4 Plotting a Function 19Notice how simple the vectorized code is—it is almost identical to the mathematicalformula
 We only have to define the range of x-values before we call the sin(x)function
 Beautiful and powerful
The program above generates the solid line in Fig
 2
1
" However, this plot has toosharp corners, because we have too few data-points"
" Let us generate 1000 x-valuesand plot sin(x) with this resolution in the same plot:>> x = linspace(0,10,1000)>> y = sin(x)>> hold(’on’)>> plot(x,y,’:’);>> hold(’off’)>> show()The result is shown in Fig"
 2
1 with a dotted line
" Here, we have used a few moretricks"
" We use the command hold(’on’) to ensure that Python does not generatea new plot, which would remove the previous one, but instead plots the data in thesame plot as we have already used"
 Typing hold(’off’) stops this behavior—otherwise all subsequent plots will be part of the same plot
 We have also used thestring ’:’ to tell Python that we want a dotted line
 You can find more plottingmethods in the summary at the end of the chapter
"The vectorization technique is very general, and usually allows you to translate amathematical formula to Python almost formula by formula"
" For example, we plotthe functionf (x) = x2e−ax sin(π x) , (2"
"3)from x = 0 to x = 10 by typing (when a = 1):>> x = linspace(0,10,1000)>> a = 1"
"0>> f = x**2*exp(-a*x)*sin(pi*x)>> plot(x,f), show()As soon as you have learned to transcribe mathematical expressions from the math-ematical notation to Python you are ready to calculate and plot any function"
The technique of vectorization is a powerful and efficient technique
 Python isusually very fast at calculating vectorized commands
" And we can write very ele-gant programs using such techniques, ensuring that the Python code follows themathematical formulation closely, which makes the code easy to understand"

5 Random NumbersSometimes you need randomness to enter your physical simulation
" For example,you may want to model the motion of a tiny dust of grain in the air bouncing aboutdue to random hits by the air molecules, so called Brownian motion"
 We model thisby having the grain move a random distance during a given time interval
" How do wecreate random numbers on the computer? Unfortunately, we cannot generate really20 2 Getting Started with Programmingrandom numbers, but most programs have decent pseudo-random number generators,which generate a sequence of numbers that appear to be random"
" In Python we cansimulate the throw of a dice using>> randint(6) + 13where randint(n) generates a random integer between 0 and n − 1, where eachoutcome has the same probability"
" If you type the command several times, you willget a new answer each time"
 Python includes several functions that return randomnumbers: It can generate random real numbers between 0 and 1 using the randfunction and normal-distributed numbers (with average 0 and standard derivation 1)using the function randn
2
"6 ConditionsNow, if we return to discuss the motion of the grain of dust, we want to model itsmotion according to a simple rule: I throw a dice"
" If I get between 1 and 3, the grainmoves a step forward, otherwise it moves a step backward"
" How can we handle suchconditions? We need a set of conditional statements, so that we can perform a givenset of commands when a particular condition is fulfilled"
 We need an if-statement:if (expr):<statement a1><statement a2>

else:<statement b1><statement b2>

Here the expression (expr) is an expression such as randint(6)+1>3 whichmay be true or false
" If the expression is true, statements a1, a2, "


" are executed,otherwise the statements b1, b2, "


 are executed
Let us use this to find the motion of the grain
" Every time we throw the dice, thegrain moves a distance dx = ±1"
" If the grain is at position x i at step i, the grain willbe at a positionx i+1 = x i + dx "
 (2
4)at step i + 1
" We can use this rule and an if-statement to write the script to find theposition at subsequent steps i = 0, 1, 2, "
 
 
":from pylab import *n = 1000x = zeros(n,float)for i in range(n):if (randint(6)+1<=3):dx = -1else:dx = 1x[i+1] = x[i] + dx2"

"We will use if-statements throughout the text, often to enforce particular condi-tions on the motion"

7 Reading Real DataWhen you work with physics you need to handle real data: NASA publishes data forthe motion of most stellar objects; your mobile phone has an accelerometer; and aGPS that measures thousands of data-points in a few seconds
 You do not want totype in these numbers by hand
 Therefore you need to be able to read files containingnumbers

9 Euler’s method
" In mechanics, we often use Euler’s method to determine themotion of an object given how the acceleration depends on the velocity and positionof an object"
" For example, we may know that the acceleration a(x, v) is given asa(x, v) = −kx − cv"
" If we know the position x and the velocity v at a time t = 0:x(0) = x0 = 0 and v(0) = v0 = 1, we can use Euler’s method to find the positionand velocity after a small timestep Δt:v1 = v(t0 + Δt) = v(t0) + a(v(t0), x(t0))Δt (2"
9)x1 = x(t0 + Δt) = x(t0) + v(t0)Δt (2
"10)v2 = v(t1 + Δt) = v(t1) + a(v(t1), x(t1))Δt (2"
11)x2 = x(t1 + Δt) = x(t1) + v(t1)Δt (2
12)and so on
 We can therefore use this scheme to find the position x(t) and the velocityv(t) as function of time at the discrete values ti = iΔt in time
"(a) Write a function acceleration(v,x,k,C) which returns the value ofa(x, v) = −kx − Cv"

Chapter 3Units and MeasurementIn physics we study nature quantitatively—we describe nature with numbers
 Butnot with numbers alone
 We need to relate numbers to the physical world usingmeasurement units
" For example, you could measure the width of your desk using apencil as in Fig"
 3
"1, finding that the width is 6 times the length of your pencil and2"
73 times the length of your shoe
" The number alone, 6 or 2"
"73, does not make anysense in the physical world without the unit: a pencil or a shoe"
" Using a pencil ora shoe may be practical for you, but not if you want to communicate your result tosomeone else"
 Therefore we need standardized units
3
1 Standardized UnitsHere we use the standard units provided by SI1 —the Systeme International—thatprovide a few precisely defined base units
" For example, the standard unit for length inthe SI system is called 1 m"
" To ensure that this standard is the same everywhere thereis a standard meter bar, made of platinum-iridium, which is kept at the InternationalBureau of Weights and Measures outside Paris"
 Accurate copies of this bar have beensent to various national standards laboratories around the world
All other units are derived from the base units in Table 3
1
" For example, the unitfor force is Newton and the unit for energy is Joule"
" Both are defined as combinationsof the base units in the SI system:1 Newton = 1 N = 1 kg m s−2 , (3"
1)1 Joule = 1 J = 1 N m = 1 kg m s−2 m = 1 kg m2 s−2

 The Orbiter was last heard from as it approached Mars way too close tothe surface
 It turned out that the two groups in NASA working on the approach ofthe Orbiter used different measurement units
" One group used English units (feet andpounds) and the other group used metric units (meters and kilograms), and they hadnot communicated this difference clearly"
 The result was devastating for the Orbiterand now serves as a warning for all of us: Keep track of your units!2 http://en

1 Standardized Units 33Numerical NotationMeasured quantities in the SI system may be very large or very small
" For example,the velocity of light in the SI system is:c = 299792458 m/s , (3"
3)and the length of the E
 coli bacteria isl = 0
000001 m 
 (3
"4)A more practical way to represent these numbers is to use scientific notation, wherewe use a base of 10"
 The velocity of light is then:c = 2
"9979248 × 10 8 m/s , (3"
5)and the length of the E
 coli bacteria isl = 1 × 10−6 m 
 (3
6)We no longer need to count the number of digits to see the order of magnitude of thenumber
" This notation is also used by Python where we give a number by a decimalnumber followed by e and the number x of tens, corresponding to the exponent x in10x :>>> l = 0"
000001>>> l9
9999999999999995e-07(Notice also the problem with numerical representation of numbers in this example)
"Similarly, we use scientific notation when we input numbers in Python>>> u = 1"
25e6>>> u1250000
"0PrefixesTo make life simpler, there are prefixes for various standard factors so that we do nothave to write out the power of tens each time"
 Instead of writing0
001 m = 1
"0 × 10−3 m , (3"
7)we write0
001 m = 1 millimeter = 1 mm 
 (3
"8)34 3 Units and MeasurementSimilarly, we write1 nm = 1 × 10−9 m , (3"
9)and the well-known kilometer:1 km = 1 × 10 3 m = 1000 m 
 (3
10)We need a large span of prefixes because our physical world spans over a large rangeof scales
3
"2 Changing UnitsThere are many different units used to describe real world quantities: We may measurespeed in meters per second, kilometers per hour or feet per second"
 How do wetranslate between them? Conversion is done by substituting equivalent quantitiesrepresented by different units
The method is best demonstrated by example
" For example, the speedometer inyour car reports the speed to be 60 kilometers per hour (km/h)"
 How can you convertthis to meters per second (m/s)? This is done by replacing km with meters and hourswith seconds by rewriting the units: 1 km = 1000 m and 1 h = 3600 s:60 kmh = 60 1000 m3600 s = 16
6 ms 
 (3
"11)What about the reverse scheme? If the wind is blowing 20 meters per second (m/s),what does this correspond to in kilometers per hour (km/h)? We use the same tech-nique as above, although we need an intermediate step to write 1 m in terms of kmand 1 s in terms of hours:1 km = 1000 m ⇒ 11000 km = 1 m ; , (3"
12)and similarly:1 h = 3600 s ⇒ 13600 h = 1 s 
 (3
13)We use these expressions to convert from m/s to km/h:20 ms = 2011000 km13600 h = 20 36001000kmh = 72 kmh

3 Uncertainty and Significant Digits 353
"3 Uncertainty and Significant DigitsMeasured quantities are never exact, but have some uncertainty, which depends onthe measurement method"
 We specify the uncertainty of a measurement by givinga range of values for the measured quantity
 If a length is given as 25
0 ± 0
"5 m, itmeans that length most probably is between 25"
0 − 0
5 m and 25
0 + 0
5 m
" (Forquantities with a known distribution of values, we typically describe the range bythe standard deviation of the measured quantity)"
In practice we use an even briefer way of specifying the uncertainty—by onlygiving the significant digits when we write down the numerical value of a quantity
For a distance of 25
0 ± 0
5 m it does not make sense to provide many more digits forthe length
 Writing 25
0000 ± 0
"5 m clearly overstates the precision, since we do notreally know whether the number is 24"
5 m or 25
5 m
 Instead we use the number ofdigits to indicate the uncertainty
 We only provide the number of digits we are certainof—the significant digits
 Instead of writing d = 25
0 ± 0
5 m we write d = 25 m
This would imply the same: we do not really know whether it is 25
5 m or 24
"6 m,but we know that it is not 22 m"
 Standard practice is that the last digit provided maybe uncertain
" If you write d = 25 m is means that the value could be d = 24 m ord = 26 m, and if you write d = 25"
0 m it means that the value could be d = 25
"05 m,but is probably not d = 25"
15 m
This implied uncertainty is why you should never report the full numerical valuesyou get from your calculator or your program
 Your program returns a lot of digits—as many digits as it stores—but these digits may not be significant
 You thereforeneed to ensure that you report only the number of significant digits
 But how do youknow that? You know it because the uncertainty of the result of your calculationswill depend on the uncertainty of the numbers you put in
 Your calculations cannotimprove the uncertainty! The results you report must therefore always reflect thenumber of significant digits in the data you start with
 And it is the number with thelargest uncertainty that determines the final uncertainty
"You will learn more formally about how to handle uncertainties in complex cal-culations in your laboratory courses, but for now you can use the following rules ofthumb for handling the number of significant digits:Multiplication: The number with the least number of significant digits determinesthe number of significant digits of the resultAddition: It is the position of the decimal point in each of the numbers that determinesthe uncertainty"
"For addition, the position of the decimal point and not the number of significantdigits determines the uncertainty of the result:3"
"4 mm + 10 mm = 13 mm , (3"
15)1000
"00 m + 5 m = 1005 m , (3"
16)36 3 Units and Measurement1 km + 10 m = 1 km + 0
"010 km = 1 km , (3"
17)1
000 km + 10 m = 1
000 km + 0
010 km = 1
"010 km , (3"
18)where you see how we lose small numbers due to uncertainty in the addends
"For multiplication, the number of significant digits in the result cannot be largerthan in any of the factors:2"
10101 N × 4
0 m = 8
"4 Nm , (3"
19)2 kN × 4
"400 m = 9 Nm , (3"
20)2 kN × 4
000 m × 2
600 s = 2 × 10 1 Nms

21)3
4 Numerical RepresentationSeveral challenges arise when we use a computer to solve physics problems
" First,the computer only stores numbers and not the units"
 Therefore you need to keep trackof the units
" Second, your programs always provide more digits than the number ofsignificant digits, so you have to keep track of the number of significant digits"
" Third,the computer introduces new errors by itself—errors due to the digital representationof numbers, and errors that are inherent in the algorithms we use to solve a problem"
"Units on the ComputerThere are no units in your program, so you need to keep track of the units yourself"
If you calculate the velocity of a car driving 2
0 km in 10
"0 s, you find:>>> x = 2"
0>>> t = 10
0>>> v = x/t>>> v0
20000000000000001It is your job to know that the units for the answer is m/s
 Because you could havedone exactly the same calculation with x = 2
0 km and t = 10
"0 s, and the answerwould instead be 0"
2 km/s
 Or you could have done the calculation x = 2
0 nm andt = 10
"0 ms, and the result would have been ν = 0"
2 nm/ms
How to ensure that you keep track of the units correctly? We advice you to writethe units into your code when you define numbers
" In your script, you could write:x = 2"
0 # mt = 10
"0 # sThis does not solve the problem, but this is a habit that makes it easier for you tospot the units"
3
"4 Numerical Representation 37In addition, we advice you to always use units on the axes in your plots"
" Indeed,we argue that a plot in physics is not complete without units on the axes"
" Make thisa habit from the start!Finally, as you become more proficient in numerical methods, you should alsolearn how to rewrite your equations in non-dimensional form"
Too Many or Too Few Digital DigitsYour program tends to return a long sequence of numbers irrespective of the numberof digits you put in: It does not care about significant numbers as do we:>>> x = 10
0;>>> t = 3
0;>>> x/t3
"3333333333333335It is therefore always your job not to report the numbers you get out directly, but toapply the rules of the number of significant digits before you report the calculatedvalue"
Digital Representation of NumbersThe numbers you use in your program can be of various types and are stored digitallyin various ways
"Numbers in computers are stored in units of 4 or 8 bytes, which is the size mostefficiently handled by the hardware"
 One byte corresponds to an 8-bit binary number
"One bit is a binary number, which means that it is either 0 or 1"
 With 8 bits we canmake 2 8 different numbers
" For example, we could enumerate the numbers from 0to 255 = 2 8 − 1"
" You may use binary as a data type in your programs, but youwill usually use either integers, called integers, or real numbers, called floating pointnumbers"
IntegersIntegers are usually either represented by 4 or 8 bytes of computer memory
 Thismeans that there is a maximum number that can be represented
 If you use a 4-byte integer the integers can range from −2 31 = −2 147 483 648 to 2 31 − 1 =2 147 483 647
" However, in Python your programming language will sort out prob-lems if you exceed this number by automatically switching to a data type such as a8 byte integer"
" 33 In other programming languages, type switching is not standard, and you may “run out of integers”with surprising results"
"38 3 Units and MeasurementNotice that if you define two numbers as integers, for example, by introducingthem as integers when you assign values to the variables, the operations betweentwo such variables will be integer operations"
" For example, division will be integerdivision, and will return an integer:>>> a = 4>>> b = 3>>> a/b1Therefore, you should make it a habit of adding a "
"0 to all numbers when you assignvariables, unless you are sure you want to define an integer"
"Floating-Point NumbersWhile floating-point numbers are supposed to represent real numbers, they also havea finite digital precision, corresponding to the number of possible values that can bespanned by the 4 or 8 bytes used to represent the floating-point number"
"Floating point numbers are represented by the (significant) digits, and an exponent,using the method that we called scientific notation"
"For a 4-byte floating-point number, the IEEE4 standard determines that 23 bitsare used for the digits and 9 bits are used for the exponents - including the signsfor both"
" 4-byte floating point numbers therefore have 6-9 (significant) digits, andcover a range from −3"
4 × 10 38 to −1
"4 × 10−45 for negative numbers, and from1"
4 × 10−45 to 3
4 × 10 38 for positive numbers
"However, you will not encounter 4-byte numbers when programming in Pythonsince by default the floating-point numbers are 8-byte"
" In this case, numbers have15-17 (significant) digits, and cover a range from −1"
"8 × 10 308 to −5 × 10−324 fornegative numbers, and from 5 × 10−324 to 1"
8 × 10 308 for positive numbers
 With 8-byte floating-point numbers you will seldom encounter cases where you are limitedby the numerical precision
 For all practical purposes you will be limited by thenumber of significant digits in your measurements
" While the number of significantdigits usually does not pose a practical problem, we still need to remember that thefloating-point numbers only have a given resolution"
" Not all numbers are possible torepresent, and rounding errors may pop up in unexpected places"
 For example:>>> l = 0
0000001>>> l9
"9999999999999995e-08shows that even when you just enter a number, it may not be stored as exactly thesame number as you entered, however, the error, the uncertainty, is very small"
 Thishas few practical consequences
 But there is one practical consequence you shouldbe aware of: You should not test if a floating-point number is equal to a particularvalue
" For example, you are usually advised not to test if a variable is exactly equalto zero, but rather test when it is very close to zero or when the variable changes sign"

"4 Numerical Representation 39For example, if you model a falling ball as a function of time, you may experiencethat it never reaches precisely zero height, it may be slightly above 0 at one time andthen slightly below 0 at the next timestep—independently of how small you makeyour time steps"
" Therefore, be careful when checking if a value is exactly equal tozero!Numerical ErrorsWe will address various numerical methods throughout this book"
" You should beaware that the numerical methods themselves may also introduce errors, and thatthese errors in some cases can be non-negligible"
" This may be because the methodsare unsuited for the problems we address, or it may, for example, be that you use toolarge an integration step"
"For most numerical methods from calculus, such as for numerical derivationand integration, the error from the numerical calculation depends on the size of theintegration step, which usually corresponds to the time step"
" Typically, the errordecreases with the integration step, and you can improve your error by decreasingyour integration step"
" But only up to a certain limit, beyond which numerical roundingerrors dominate"
 Trying to get very precise results be choosing very small integrationsteps can therefore sometimes lead to large errors
 We will address these features indetail when we discuss the various numerical methods
"You must always take extra care when applying a numerical method to analyzeyour problem because:• the method you apply may have an error that may affect the number of significantdigits in your answer• the method you apply may be unstable, producing errors that are orders of mag-nitude off the correct result• you may have implemented the method incorrectly, producing a result that issignificantly wrongWe therefore always use our physical intuition and insight when we analyze ourresults"
 You need to check whether the results are reasonable compared with yourintuition
" And you also need to check whether the results violate basic physicalprinciples, such as the conservation laws of mass and momentum that you willlearn throughout this book"
" However, by ensuring that you always test your meth-ods against standardized problems with know solutions before venturing into theunknown, numerical methods provide a robust, versatile set of tools that allows usto solve practically any problem in mechanics with the precision we want"

" As soon as you have figured out what forcesare acting on them, and you have found a model that predicts the magnitude anddirection of the force during the motion, you can find the acceleration of the object"
From the acceleration you can determine the motion of the object given its startingposition and velocity
" You will work through this procedure repeatedly over the nextchapters, gradually filling all the concepts with meaning, until the procedure becomesa natural part of your way of thinking"
"In this chapter we concentrate on developing our intuition of motion, on findingmethods to formulate mathematical equations that determine the motion, and ondeveloping analytical and numerical methods to solve the equations of motion"
You will learn to describe the motion of an object by its position as a function oftime
" We introduce the velocity and the acceleration of an object, which are the firstand second time-derivatives of the position of the object"
 We also show how to findexpressions for the motion from the velocity or acceleration—finding the equationsof motion for the object

Position and TimeFrom Fig

0 m when t = 0 s and atx(3 s) = 21

" Even though we have only measured the positionat discrete times ti , we expect the position of the runner to vary continuously withtime, as illustrated by the plot of x(t) in Fig"

" This is indeed how we characterizemotion:The motion of an object is described by the position, x(t), as a function oftime, t, measured in a given reference system"
Reference System and OriginWe have chosen to measure the position x along the lane
 We call this direction thex-axis
" The position x is measured from the starting line, which we call the origin—the point where x is zero"
 The choice of an origin and an axis is called a referencesystem
 The axis has a direction which tells us in what direction x is increasing—thisis indicated by the arrow on the axis
" The axis is directed from the starting line to thefinishing line, so that the position of the runner increases during the race"
"You are free to choose the axes and the origin of your reference system as youlike, but we usually try to choose so that measurements become simple, as we havedone here"

" The instantaneous velocity is illustrated by the slope of the dotted blueline, which corresponds to the slope of the tangent to the curve at t = 1 s"
VelocityThe motion diagram in Fig

 The change in position from time t = 1 s to t = 2 s is:x(2 s) − x(1 s) = 11
1 m − 3
4 m = 7
7 m (4
"1)We call this change the displacement, Δx(1 s):The displacement Δx(t1) over the time interval from t = t1 to t = t1 + Δt isdefined as:Δx(t1) = x(t1 + Δt) − x(t1) "
 (4
2)4
1 Description of Motion 47The displacement is read directly from the motion diagram as the length of the linefrom x(1 s) to x(2 s)
 The displacement has a direction—it is the displacement fromx(ti ) to x(ti + Δt)—and it is therefore drawn as an arrow in Fig
 4
1
The first few displacements in Fig
 4
1 are increasing
 This means that he is runningfaster
" But how fast is he running? This cannot be described by displacement alone,because the displacements become smaller when we decrease the time interval asshown in Fig"
 4
1
 It is the displacement per time that describes how fast he is running:The average velocity from t = t1 to t = t1 + Δt is:¯v(t1) = x(t1 + Δt) − x(t1)Δt = Δx(t1)Δt 
 (4
"3)The average velocity has units meters per second, m/s"
The average velocities for the runner in Fig
 4
1 at t = 1 s and t = 2 s over the timeinterval Δt = 1 s are:¯v(1 s) = 7
7 m1 s = 7
"7 m/s , (4"
4)¯v(2 s) = 10
2 m1 s = 10
"2 m/s , (4"
"5)However, if we calculate the average velocity from the bottom-most diagram inFig"

"1, the time interval is Δt = 0"
"5 s, and the velocities are:¯v(1 s) = 3"
5 m0
5 s = 7
"0 m/s , (4"
6)¯v(2 s) = 4
9 m1 s = 9
"8 m/s , (4"
7)We see that the average velocities depend on the time interval Δt! We can understandthis from the inset in Fig
 4
2
" First, we notice that we can read the average velocity¯v(1 s) directly from the curve, x(t), as the slope of the curve from the point x(1 s) tothe point x(1 s + Δt)"
" From the figure, we see that ¯v changes slightly as we changethe time interval from Δt = 1 s to Δt = 0"
5 s because the function x(t) is curving
"However, we also see that when the time interval Δt becomes smaller and smaller,the average velocity approaches a specific value given as the slope of the curve inthe point t = 1 s"
" We call the velocity in this limit the instantaneous velocity at thetime t, v(t):48 4 Motion in One DimensionThe instantaneous velocity is defined as the time derivative of the position:v(t) = limΔt→0x(t + Δt) − x(t)Δt = dxdt "
 (4
"8)In the following, whenever we use the term velocity, we will mean the instantaneousvelocity"
"Notation for Time DerivativesNotice that the notation x′(t) for the derivative that you may be used to from calculus,is not commonly used in physics"
" This is to avoid confusion with x′, which is oftenused to represent a length in a coordinate system called the “marked” coordinatesystem"
" The notation x′(t) can therefore be ambiguous: it may be interpreted as theposition x′ as a function of time, or as the time derivative of the position x"
" Instead,we denote the time derivative of a quantity by the placing a dot over it"
 The velocityis therefore often written as:v(t) = dxdt = ˙x 
 (4
"9)Visualizing the Velocity v(t)The velocity v(t) represents the slope of the curve, x(t)"
" In many cases it may beuseful to visualize the motion by looking at both the plot of x(t) and the plot ofv(t), as shown in Fig"

" In this case, it is evident that the velocity is changingthroughout the motion"
" Initially, the velocity is increasing as the runner sprints outFig"

1 Description of Motion 49from the starting line
" In the middle of the race the velocity is approximately constant,while at the end of the race, the runner is slowing down, and the velocity is falling"
AccelerationThe velocity may also vary throughout the motion
 From Fig
 4
3 we see that therunner starts at rest and increases his velocity with time
" Just as we introduced thevelocity to characterize the rate of change of position, we introduce the accelerationto characterize the rate of change of the velocity:The average acceleration over a time interval Δt from t to t + Δt is:¯a(t) = v(t + Δt) − v(t)Δt "
 (4
10)The instantaneous acceleration is the limit of the average acceleration when the timeinterval approaches zero:The instantaneous acceleration is defined as:a(t) = limΔt→0v(t + Δt) − v(t)Δt = dvdt = ˙v 
 (4
11)When we use the term acceleration we mean the instantaneous acceleration
The acceleration can be found as the slope of the v(t) curve
 Figure 4
3 shows a plotof a(t) together with both position x(t) and velocity v(t)
 Notice that the accelerationcurve is “noisy” and consists of clear steps
" This is not a physical effect, but rather aneffect of how the data was gathered and interpolated"
 Real data often have noise fromvarious sources—so you should expect noisy curves when you look at real systems
(You can learn more about how this data was measured in boltdatabox1 )
"Because the velocity is given as the time derivative of the position x(t), we canalso write the acceleration as the time derivative of the position x(t) by inserting(4"

 The top figure shows the velocities at time intervalsof 1 s
 The displacements are interpreted as velocities
 The top figure shows how the change invelocity at t = 2 s is constructed from the velocity at t = 1s and the velocity at t = 2 s
" Theresulting difference, Δv(2 s) is interpreted as the average acceleration"
" The bottom figure shows theaccelerations estimated from the motion diagramUsing the dot-notation, we can write this as:a(t) = ˙v(t) = ¨x(t) , (4"
13)or in shorthanda = ˙v = ¨x 
 (4
"14)Interpretation of Motion DiagramsIt is often difficult to obtain a good intuition for acceleration, in particular for two- andthree-dimensional motions, but sometimes also for one-dimensional motions"
 Expe-rience shows that motion diagrams are useful tools for developing a good intuitionfor accelerations—this is why we include them here
"As long as all the time intervals in a motion diagram are identical, the displace-ments in the motion diagram may be interpreted as average velocities"
 In Fig
 4
"4 thedisplacements and therefore the average velocities, are initially increasing, until att = 4 s they are approximately constant"
 The change in average velocity from t = 1 sto t = 2 s is:Δ¯v(1 s) = ¯v(2 s) − ¯v(1 s) = 5 m/s (4
15)We introduce the average acceleration2 as:2 The attentive reader may realize that the average acceleration should really be defined in terms ofthe change in instantaneous velocity: ¯a = (v(t + Δt) − v(t))/Δt and not in terms of the averagevelocity as done here
" However, this small difference in definitions becomes insignificant when thetime interval becomes sufficiently small"

 The first few images were combined into one picture as shown in Fig

"From the sequence of images, we measure the vertical position of the ball by compar-ing the height of the center of the ball to the ruler seen in the images"
 The positionsare shown in Table 4
2
We draw the motion diagram by marking the positions yi with dots along thevertically oriented y-axis as illustrated in Fig
 4
5
" We illustrate the velocities bythe displacements, which are drawn as arrows from point to point"
 The averagevelocities can be calculated from the data: For each i in Table 4
2 we calculate theaverage velocity from ti to ti+1 using:¯vi = yi+1 − yiΔt 
 (4
17)The corresponding results are shown in the table
" However, we cannot use this methodto find a value for i = 5 since we do not know y6 "
 We find that all the velocitiesare negative
 Since we have chosen the positive direction to be up (the arrow on they-axis points upward) this means that the ball is falling down—as expected
The velocities are increasing in magnitude since the ball is accelerating downward
"We estimate the average accelerations by¯ai = ¯vi − ¯vi−1Δt , (4"
18)and the results are shown in Table 4
2
" For the accelerations, we cannot find a valuefor ¯ai for i = 0 or for i = 5, since the velocity are not defined at i = −1 or at i = 5"
If you look at Fig
 4

The data shows that the acceleration is approximately constant a  −9

8 m/s 2 is a constant and y0 is the position of the tennis ball at t = 0 s
Let us see how this model matches up with the observed data

" This is done using a for-loop:n = len(x);dt = t[1] - t[0];v = zeros(n-1,float);for i in range(n-1):v[i] = (x[i+1] - x[i])/dt;Here, we find n, the number of elements in the y-array, and the time difference dt,which we calculate from the first two times since the time intervals are regular"
" Wealso prepare an empty array v, which we will fill with velocities"
" But why do weonly make it n − 1 elements long? Because the formula v[i] = (y[i+1] –y[i])/dt, cannot be applied to the last element in the array, since we would thenhave no data for i + 1"
 (We saw the same in Table 4

 Using the accelerationfor comparisons was therefore a better approach to spot the differences

" Such problems cannot be solved by directintegration, because the function x(t) and its derivatives occur on both sides ofthe equation"
 Such equations are called differential equations

Background: In Sect

1 we studied the motion of a falling tennis ball based onmeasurements of its motion
" However, in physics we do not only want to observemotion, we want to predict it"
" We do this by first analyzing the problem to find theforces acting on the object, and from the forces we find a mathematical model ofthe acceleration of the object"
 (You will learn to do this in the next chapter
 For nowwe will assume that the acceleration is given)
" From the acceleration, we find theposition and velocity by analytical or numerical integration"
 We call this recipe thestructured problem-solving approach
System sketch: Your first step should always be to make a sketch the process
" Inphysics, our sketches are vessels for our thoughts"
" A good, functional sketch istherefore an important part of solving a problem"
 While the left part of Fig
 4
"9 hasa nice artistic appeal and also illustrates the motion in detail, we do not encouragesuch detailed sketches"
" Instead, you should make a sketch that only focuses on themost important features of the process, as in the rightmost figure"
" Here we illustratethe object (the tennis ball), its surroundings (most importantly the floor), and thecoordinate system with a clearly marked axis"
" We have also illustrated the initialposition and velocity of the ball, and its position and velocity at a time t"
" Drawinga simplified illustration helps you discern the important from the unimportant, andit helps you convert a physical situation into a mathematical problem: The figureshows the axis and the position of the ball, y(t), and nothing else"

55)Solving this equation means to find the velocity v(t) and the position y(t) of the ballfor any time t
" We call this the modeling step, finding the mathematical problem tosolve, and the next step is to solve this problem—to find v(t) and y(t)"

 Weknow the position and velocity as a function of time
" When you have this solution,you are prepared to answer any question about the motion"
" For example, you canfind out when the ball hits the ground and you can find the velocity of the ball whenit hits the ground"
 How would you do that? You need to translate the question intoa mathematical problem
" We do this by stating the condition “when the ball hits theground” in mathematical terms: The ball hits the ground when its position is that ofthe ground, that is, when y(t) = 0 m"
" (Notice, we have ignored the extent of the ballhere)"
 We can use our solution in (4

 For a tennis ball D = 0

 (You will learn about the background for this model and howto determine values for D later)

"Solution of the realistic model: Our task is to solve this problem, which means tofind v(t) and y(t) for the ball"
 This can be done either numerically or analytically
"The numerical solution is straightforward, using the approach we have derived, butthe analytical solution requires some knowledge of differential equations"
Numerical solution: We apply Euler-Cromer’s method to find the positions andvelocities by stepwise integration starting from the initial conditions
" The integrationstep in Euler-Cromer’s method is:v(ti + Δt) = v(t0) + a(ti , vi , yi ) Δt (4"

 (Try it and see)
"Test your understanding: What would happen if we considered that the ball had an initial velocityv0 = −2v T when it started? Sketch the resulting position, velocity and acceleration as a functionof time"
Analytical solution: The differential equation in (4
66) is one of a few equations wecan solve analytically as long as the velocity does not change sign
" When the ball isfalling down, the velocity is negative, and we can replace |v| by −v:70 4 Motion in One Dimensiondvdt = −g − Dv (−v) = −g + D v2 "
 (4

"We separate the variables, so that all v’s are on the left side and all t’s are on theright: dvg − Dv2 = −1 dt "
 (4
"71)The differential equation can now be solved by integrating each side from v0 = 0 m/sto v and from t0 = 0 s to t:∫ vv0dvg − Dv2 =∫ tt0−1 dt = −t , (4"
"72)The left-side integral can be solved using your knowledge from calculus (or by usingthe symbolic solver in Python) giving:∫ v0dvg − Dv2 = 1g v T tanh−1( vv T), (4"

 (4

31 Sliding on snow
 In this project we address the motion of an object sliding ona slippery surface—such as a ski sliding in a snowy track
" You will learn how to findthe equation of motion for sliding systems both analytically and numerically, and tointerpret the results"
We start by studying a simplified situation called frictional motion: A block issliding on a surface
 moving with a velocity v in the positive x-direction
" The forcesfrom the interactions with the surface results in an acceleration:a =⎧⎨⎩−μ(|v|)g v > 00 v = 0μ(|v|)g v < 0, (4"
82)where g = 9
8 m/s 2 is the acceleration of gravity
 Let us first assume that μ(v) =μ = 0
1 for the surface
" That is, we assume that the coefficient of friction does notdepend on the velocity of the block"
 We give the block a push and release it with avelocity of 5 m/s
" (a) Find the velocity, v(t), of the block"
(b) How long time does it take until the block stops?(c) Write a program where you find v(t) numerically using Euler’s or Euler-Cromer’smethod
 (Hint: You can find a program example in the textbook
) Use the programto plot v(t) and compare with your analytical solution
 Use a timestep of Δt = 0
01
The description of friction provided above is too simplified
 The coefficient offriction is generally not independent of velocity
" For dry friction, the coefficient offriction can in some cases be approximated by the following formula:μ(v) = μd + μs − μd1 + v/v∗ , (4"
83)where μd = 0
"1 often is called the dynamic coefficient of friction, μs = 0"
"2 is calledthe static coefficient of friction, and v∗ = 0"
5 m/s is a characteristic velocity for thecontact between the block and the surface
"(d) Show that the acceleration of the block is:a(v) = −μd g − g μs − μd1 + v/v∗ , (4"
84)for v > 0
"(e) Use your program to find v(t) for the more realistic model, with the same start-ing velocity, and compare with your previous results"
 Are your results reasonable?Explain
The model we have presented so far is only relevant at small velocities
" At highervelocities the snow or ice melts, and the coefficient of friction displays a differentdependency on velocity:4"
"2 Calculation of Motion 81μ(v) = μm( vvm)− 12when v > vm , (4"
85)where vm is the velocity where melting becomes important
 For lower velocities themodel presented above with static and dynamic friction is still valid
"(f) Show thatμm = μd + μs − μd1 + vm /v∗ , (4"
86)in order for the coefficient of friction to be continuous at v = vm 
(g) Modify your program to find the time development of v for the block whenvm = 1
5 m/s
 Compare with the two other models above: The model without velocitydependence and the model for dry friction
 Comment on the results
(h) The process may be clearer if you plot the acceleration for all the three modelsin the same plot
" Modify your program to plot a(t), plot the results, and commenton the results"
" What would happen if the initial velocity was much higher or muchlower than 5 m/s?Chapter 5Forces in One DimensionWhat determines how far a bungee-jumper falls before he starts moving upward? Inthis chapter you acquire the tools to answer this, sometimes critical, question"
We have introduced a structured approach to find the motion of a object fromits acceleration and the initial conditions (see Fig
 5
1)
" But how do we find theacceleration? We could measure it directly, as we did with an accelerometer, but thisis not satisfactory"
" Physics is not only about describing what is happening, but ratherabout explaining and predicting motion"
" In order to determine the motion, we needto be able to predict the acceleration of an object"
In this chapter we will show you that the acceleration of an object is related to theforces acting on the object
" In order to predict the motion, we need to:• Find what forces are acting on an object"
• Introduce quantitative models for the forces—we need numbers for the forces inorder to have numbers for the acceleration
• Determine the acceleration from the forces using Newton’s second law of motion
• “Solve” the motion from the differential equations of motion and the initial con-ditions
We will address these points in detail: First we show how to identify the forcesacting on an object
 Then we introduce Newton’s second law that relates forces toacceleration
" Finally, we introduce models for some of the most common forces inthe macroscopic world"

"2 Illustration of a two hands pulling on a rubber band, b a rubber band attached to a wall, ca spring attached to a wall, d a rope attached to a wall, e a book above a table, f a book on a table,g deformation of surface bump, h magnification of bumpwill feel that the pull becomes stronger—the force acting on her becomes larger"
" Inaddition, the rubber band stretches"
" The harder you pull, the longer the rubber bandbecomes"
"If you instead tie the rubber band to the wall, the rubber band will again elongateas you pull"
" But now it is not a person experiencing the pull, it is the wall"
 A forcemay indeed act on the wall as well as on a person
" If we pull harder, the rubber bandelongates further, and we expect the force on the wall to become larger"
" This suggeststhat the elongation of the band is a reasonable way to measure the magnitude of theforce, and this is indeed the usual way to define a force: by prescribing how we canmeasure it"
 We can measure forces by how they deform rubber bands
"Now, there is nothing special about a rubber band"
 We could replace the rubberband by a spring or any other material
" As you pull on the spring, the spring elongates"
5
"1 What Is a Force? 85If the spring is stiff, it elongates less than the rubber band, but it still elongatessomewhat"
" A rope may be even stiffer, and would deform even less, but a carefulmeasurement would show that also a rope elongates when pulled"
We are nearing a definition of a force
 We could define a force as an interaction—apull or a push on an object—that can be measured by the deformation of a spring
 Inthis case the magnitude of the force increases with the deformation of the spring
" Thisdefinition is not altogether satisfactory, but it illustrates a particular type of force—what we call a contact force"
 Contact forces occur where an object is in contact withother objects
"What about a book lying on a table, are there any forces acting on the book? Thebook is not moving, so we may be tempted to say no"
" Unfortunately, this would bewrong"
" When we pulled on the wall with the spring, the wall was not moving, butthere was still a force acting on it"
" What about the book—where are the forces actingon the book? First, there is one force we have not discussed so far, the force of gravity"
This is one of the fundamental forces in nature: There are gravitation forces betweenany two objects pulling the objects toward each other
" There is a gravitational forcefrom the Earth on the book, which pulls the book downward"
What is stopping the book from moving? The table! But how? We cannot seeany deformation as we could for the rubber band
 This is only because you do notlook carefully enough
" If you zoomed in on the contact between the book and thetable using a microscope, you would see that the surface of the table and the surfaceof the book are not flat, but rough"
 Small surface irregularities can be seen alongthe surfaces
" When the book is placed on the table, these small irregularities deform(see Fig"
 5
2)
" Each irregularity acts as a small spring, and when the irregularities aredeformed, that deformation is related to the contact force between the two objects"
The sum of the forces from all of these small springs is the force from the table onthe book
"If we zoom further in on the contact between one surface irregularity and the table,we realize that the contact force really is a sum of electromagnetic forces between theatoms on the surface of the book and the atoms on the surface of the table"
" The atomsare never in actual contact, but as the book and the table are pressed toward eachother, electromagnetic forces will act from the table on the book"
" The electromagneticforce has been shown to be part of the electromagnetic and the weak nuclear force,which is one of three fundamental forces"
" The other two are gravity and the strongnuclear force, which is responsible for the interactions between subatomic particlesand for the interactions in the nucleus"
" These are the three main forces in nature, andall forces are reducible to these forces"
"In most cases, we will study objects that consist of many atoms"
" In practice, wecannot find the sum of the forces from all the individual atoms to find the magnitudeof the force, but we will instead develop simplified models for the macroscopic forceswe encounter"
" We will call such models force models, and they will be our main toolsfor determining forces on macroscopic objects"

2 Identifying ForcesThe first step in the “Model” box in our structured problem solving approach is tofind the forces acting on the object
" We therefore need a systematic way to find andidentify the forces acting on an object, and we will do this by studying a specificexample: A ball bouncing on the ground, as illustrated in Fig"
 5
3
" In the process ofstudying this example, we develop a general procedure for analyzing forces"
"First, we need to discern between the object, also called the system, and theenvironment, which is everything else"
" In this case, the system is the ball, and theenvironment is everything else, such as the floor, the air surrounding the ball, andthe Earth"
 1 We have now found the first step in our procedure:1
 Divide the problem into system and environment
"In order to find the forces acting, we must realize a fundamental characteristic ofa force:All forces acting on the system must have a source—an identifiable cause inthe environment"
A force acting on the ball must be related to an interaction with something in the envi-ronment
 This also means that we do not consider internal forces—forces betweenone part of the object and another part—we only consider external forces
"We have claimed that there are only three types of forces: gravity, the electromag-netic and weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force"
" However, this is not veryhelpful for our analysis of a macroscopic object such as the ball"
" Instead, we willdivide forces into two main types:Forces are either contact forces or long-range forces"
"1 You will see that we need to include the Earth, since the gravitational force on the ball comes fromthe interaction with the whole Earth, and not just with the floor"
5
"2 Identifying Forces 87Contact forces, as evident from the name, are forces that occur at the contact betweenthe system and the environment"
 We find contact forces by examining our drawingof the ball in Fig
 5
3
" From the drawing, we see that the ball is in contact with thefloor"
We generalize the procedure to find the contact points in the following steps:2
 Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object
3
 Draw a closed curve around the system
4
 Find contact points—these are the points where contact forces may act
"What is the contact force at this contact? The force on the ball is from the floor,and we call this force the normal force"
" It is similar to the force acting on the booklying on the table, and may be considered as a sum of many forces acting along theinterface between the ball and the floor"
 We introduce the symbol N for this force
"The symbol N represents a number (with a notation), giving the strength of the force"
"(As we will see later, forces are measured in Newton, and N is therefore measuredin Newtons"
) This step in the general procedure can be summarized as:5
 Give names and symbols to all the contact forces
The direction of the normal force from the floor on the ball depends on the directionof the floor as illustrated in Fig
 5
3d
" In order to show both the direction and themagnitude of the force, we realize that a force must be a vector, and we introducethe symbol N for the normal force"
" To illustrate the normal force acting on the ball,we draw a vector starting in the contact point, acting in the direction of the normalforce, and with a length related to its magnitude, as illustrated in Fig"
 5
3c
So far we have only discussed one of the contact forces between the ball and theenvironment
 What other contact forces are there? The ball is also in contact with theair
 The contact with the air results in several forces
 Everywhere along the surface ofthe ball there will be small drag forces because of the difference in velocity betweenthe surface of the ball and the air
" Again, we simplify by assuming that all these smallforces sum to a single force, the air resistance, FD , which is drawn as acting in asingle point on the surface of the ball, as illustrated in Fig"
 5
3c
"Similarly, there are differences in the pressure in the air, which would give rise toa buoyancy force, B, which we again assume to be acting on the surface of the ball"
"Finally, we must also look for the long-range forces affecting the ball"
 The onlylong-range force is the gravitational force acting from the Earth on the ball
" We callthis force, G, and draw it as acting in the center of the ball, in the direction towardthe center of the Earth"
This sums up the final step of our procedure:6
 Identify the long-range forces
88 5 Forces in One DimensionFree-Body DiagramWe have now defined a general procedure to find what we call the free-body diagramfor the system
" This is a diagram that identifies all the forces acting on the object,where each force is drawn as a vector starting from the point where the force isacting"
 The construction of the free-body diagram is central to mechanics—andit will typically be one of the first tasks you will do whenever you are solving amechanics problem
 We will therefore provide you with a detailed prescription forhow to draw the free-body diagram
Drawing a free-body diagram:Follow these steps to find and identify all the forces acting on an object andthen to draw the free-body diagram for the system
• Divide the problem into system and environment
• Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object
• Draw a closed curve around the system
• Find contact points—these are the points where contact forces may act
• Give names and symbols to all the contact forces
• Identify the long-range forces
• Make a drawing of the object
" Draw the forces as arrows, vectors, startingfrom where the force is acting"
 The direction of the vector indicates the(positive) direction of the force
 Try to make the length of the arrow indicatethe relative magnitude of the forces
• Draw in the axes of the coordinate system
 It is often convenient to makeone axis parallel to the direction of motion
 When you choose direction ofthe axis you also choose the positive direction for the axis
"Note that when you draw a force, you indicate the positive direction for this force"
"If you later calculate the force and find that it is negative, it simply means that theforce is acting in the opposite direction of what you thought or defined as the positivedirection when you made the drawing"
 25
3 Newton’s Second Law of MotionWe are now able to find and identify the forces acting on an object
" However, we stillneed a connection between the forces and the motion of an object"
" This connectioncan be found through Newton’s second law of motion, which relates the accelerationof an object to the forces acting on the object:2 You should, however, be aware that in some cases, this may mean that you have made an errorin your assumptions, because some forces, such as the normal force due to a contact, cannot benegative unless the objects are glued together"
5
3 Newton’s Second Law of Motion 89Newton’s second law of motion: The force F on an object of inertial mass mis related to the acceleration a of the object through F = ma
Newton’s laws of motion are laws of nature that have been found by experimentalinvestigations and have been shown to hold up to continued experimental investi-gations
 Newton’s laws are valid over a wide range of length- and time-scales
 Weuse Newton’s laws of motion to describe everything from the motion of atoms to themotion of galaxies
"Aspects of Newton’s Second LawVector equation: Newton’s second law is a vector equation: The acceleration is inthe direction of the force, and the acceleration is proportional to the force"
" In thischapter, we will only study forces and motion in one dimension"
" We will thereforewrite F = Fx i, where i is the unit vector along the x-axis"
 The one-dimensionalversion of Newton’s second law is then:Fx = ma x = m d2 xdt2 
 (5
"1)Intertial mass: Newton’s second law introduces a new property of an object—theinertial mass, m"
 We determine the inertial mass of an object by measuring theacceleration for a given applied force
" The inertial mass is measured in Grams, withthe notation g"
" Experimental studies show that inertial masses are additive: If we addtwo objects of masses m A and m B together, their total inertial mass is:m = m A + m B "
 (5
"2)Unit: Forces are measured in Newton, with the notation N"
 The definition of oneNewton is that it is the force that gives an object with (inertial) mass of 1 kg anacceleration of 1 m/s 2 
 That is:1 N = 1 kg m/s2 
 (5
"3)Net external force: The force, F, in Newton’s second law is the net external forceacting on the object"
" By external we mean that the force has a cause outside thesystem, as we insisted when we drew a free-body diagram of an object"
" By net forcewe mean that if there are several forces acting on an object, it is the sum of all theexternal forces that causes the acceleration"
 We call this sum the net force:Fnet = ∑jF j = ma 
 (5
"4)90 5 Forces in One DimensionHere we have written a sum over various forces, where each force is identified by asubindex j"
 This is a typical way of writing the net force in shorthand
" In practice, wereplace the sum, ∑j , by a sum of each of the external forces found in the free-bodydiagram"
"For example, for the ball bouncing off the floor studied above, the net force onthe ball is:Fnet = ∑jF j = G + N + FD + B "
 (5
5)Superposition: Forces are additive
 We say that they obey the superposition princi-ple
" The acceleration due to many forces, Fi , is the same as the acceleration of oneforce equal to the sum of all the small forces"
"Point particles: Newton’s second law applies to a point particle, an object locatedin a single point"
 The acceleration a is the acceleration of this point
" While theconcept of a point particle is mathematically useful, it is not that useful in a world ofmacroscopic objects that have spatial extent, such as any object we typically describein mechanics"
"Can we still use Newton’s second law for extended objects? Yes! Newton’s secondlaw is valid for the motion of any macroscopic object—even objects that deform orchange during the motions, such as bouncing football"
" But for a macroscopic objectwe need to be very precise in how we describe the position of the object, because theposition is a single point whereas the object is located in many points"
 What pointto choose? It turns out that Newton’s second law is valid if we choose a particularpoint called the center of mass of the object (or any point on the object that does notmove relative to the center of mass)
" We will introduce the center of mass formallylater, but for now we can use the (geometric) center of the object or any other pointthat does not move relative to the center"
"Because we can use Newton’s second law for both point particles and extendedobjects, we do not need to discern between point particles and extended objects fornow"
" Usually, we find it most convenient to work with real, extended physical objects,and we draw forces onto the extended objects, as shown in Fig"

" The module is in contact with the surrounding air, giving rise to the air dragforce, FD , which acts upward when the module is moving downward"
 This is theonly contact force
" In addition, it is affected by a long-range force—the gravitationalforce from the Earth, G, which acts downward toward the Earth"
"Newton’s second law: The net force on the module is:Fnet = FD + G , (5"
"6)where FD acts upward when the module is moving downward, hence FD = F D j,and G acts downward, that is, in the negative y-direction, G = −Gj:Fnet = (F D − G) i "

"Measuring the gravitational force: To determine G(ti ), we need a force model—a model that gives us a number value (and unit) for the gravitational force"
" Youprobably already know this law, G = mg, and we will introduce it later on—butwhat could you do if you did not know it? We could device a experiment to measurethe gravitational force G on the module"
" We hang the module in a wire, and measurethe force in the wire when the module is at rest"
 This is the principle behind a weight
Figure 5
4c illustrates the free-body diagram for this experiment
" Since the moduleis not moving the only contact force is T, the force from the wire on the module"
Newton’s second law in the y-direction becomes:Fnet = T − G = ma y

"10)However, we have designed this experiment so that a y = 0 m/s 2 , since the moduleis not moving, thereforeT − G = 0 ⇒ T = G "
 (5
"11)We have found that we can measure G by measuring T , which gives T = G =49,000 N"
"You will find that this use of Newton’s second law is very common, and we willreturn to it many times"
 Problems where there is no motion—or motion with constantvelocity—are often called static problems
"Calculating air resistance force: Since we now know that G = 49,000 N (and weassume this is a constant throughout the motion), we can now use the data we have fora y (ti ) for the module to find the air resistance force on the module"
" From Newton’ssecond law we have:F D − G = ma y ⇒ F D = G + ma y , (5"

"4 Force ModelsIn order to use Newton’s second law to determine the acceleration of an object, weneed to find out how large a force is—we need to determine its magnitude and direc-tion"
" For this, we need theories that provide numerical values for the forces"
 We callsuch models “force models”
" The force models may be based on direct, experimentalmeasurements"
 We often call such models phenomenological or experimental forcemodels
 The force models can also be based on a more fundamental model or a modelbased on a microscopic view of the interactions
In the following we introduce models for some of the most common types offorces acting between macro- and microscopic objects
" These models will be yourtoolbox for addressing physical processes—you need to continually build on thistoolbox, as this will be your reservoir of physical knowledge"
" If you want to describea ball falling through air, you need mathematical expressions for the forces on theball: both the force due to gravity and the force due to air resistance"
 If you want todescribe the motion of a nanometer sized particle in water close to a charged surfaceyou need to introduce (probably sophisticated) models for the forces between theparticle and the individual water molecules and between the particle and the surface
94 5 Forces in One DimensionThe range of problems you can solve depends on your knowledge of interactions—forces—and on your ability to simplify a complicated situation to a model that onlycontains forces you know how to address

5 Force Model: Gravitational ForceAnother of Newton’s great accomplishments is his discovery of the law of gravity
"According to Newton’s law of gravity, there are attractive, gravitational forcesbetween all objects"
" The gravitational force on object A from object B is:Ffrom B on A = γ m · Mr3ABrAB , (5"
"13)Here rAB is a vector pointing from the center of object A to the center of object B, andr AB is the length of this vector, corresponding to the distance between the centers ofobjects A and B (see Fig"
 5
6)
" The quantities m and M are the gravitational massesof objects A and B respectively, and γ is the gravitational constant"
All experimental evidence shows that the gravitational masses are the same as theinertial masses
" We will therefore use the same symbol, m for both the inertial massand the gravitational mass of an object"
Constant GravityThe general gravitational law becomes simpler for an object near the surface of theEarth or another planet
" In this case, the distance r AB from the object to the centerof the Earth is approximately constant and equal to the radius R of the Earth"
 Thegravitational force can therefore be approximated by:Fig

The constant g only depends on the radius and mass of the planet
"The Acceleration of GravityWhy do we call g the acceleration is gravity? Because this is the acceleration of anobject that is subject only to a gravitational force, which is easily seen from Newton’ssecond law applied to an object only affected by gravity:ma = G = −mg j , (5"

6 Force Model: Viscous ForceYou will often encounter objects that are in contact with a surrounding fluid suchas a air or water
 We therefore need a force model for the interaction between fluidsand solid objects
" Unfortunately, there is no fundamental law of nature for suchan interaction"
" Instead, we must determine the force model from experiments orcalculations based on an underlying model for fluid flow, and use this result as ourmodel"
" Fortunately, experiments and calculations show that the force from the fluidhas a simple form—it depends on the velocity of the object"
"Drag Force at Low VelocitiesIf you pull a sphere through water, you expect a contact force F D from the wateron the sphere counteracting the motion of the sphere relative to water because wateris forced to flow around the sphere"
 Both experiments and theoretical models showthat for low velocities the fluid flows smoothly around the object (see Fig
 5
"7), andthe force, F D , from the fluid is proportional to the velocity of the object relative tothe fluid"
"The viscous force on an object moving at a velocity v relative to a fluid is:F D = −k v v , (5"
"17)where k v is a constant that depends on the objects size, shape and surface, as well ason the (dynamic) viscosity of the fluid"

7 Illustration of a drag force on an object due to the motion of the object relative to thesurrounding fluid
" At low velocities the fluid flow around the object is smooth, and the force isapproximately proportional to the velocity"
" At higher velocities, the fluid flow becomes turbulentnear the surface, the flow becomes irregular, and the force is approximately proportional to thesquare of the velocityWe call a force that is proportional to the velocity (of the object) a viscous force"
If the force is a contact force from a fluid we also often use the term drag force todescribe the interaction
Drag Force at High VelocitiesAt larger velocities the fluid flow around the object becomes more irregular (seeFig
 5
"7), and the drag force is not mainly related to the forces required to dragthe fluid along the surface of the object, but instead depends on the under-pressuregenerated behind the object"
" In this case, the force is proportional to the square ofthe velocity, and we call this law the square law of air resistance"
"The drag force on an object moving at a velocity v relative to a fluid is:F D = −Dv2 , (5"
19)acting in the direction opposite the velocity
The minus sign shows that the force acts in the direction opposite the velocity
" Theprefactor D is a constant that depends on the objects size, shape and surface, and98 5 Forces in One Dimensionthe density of the fluid"
 Experimental data gives an approximative value for D for aspherical object:D  12
0 ρ R2 
 (5
"20)where ρ is the density of the fluid, and R is the radius of the sphere"
General Model for Fluid DragThe behaviors for low and high velocities are special cases of a more general modelfor the drag force
" Experiments show that the drag force can be written in the generalform:F D = 12 ρ S C D (v, η, ρ, d)v2 , (5"
21)where ρ is the density of the fluid
 For air ρ = 1
293 kg/m 3 at normal pressures andtemperatures
 S is the cross-sectional area of the object—that means the area of theobject’s projection on a plane normal to the direction of motion
 For a sphere withradius r the cross-sectional area is S = πr2 
 The speed of the object relative to thefluid is v
" The viscosity of the fluid is η, and d is a characteristic length scale, suchas the diameter of a sphere"
 The coefficient C D (
 
 
) is called the drag coefficientand describes the details of the air resistance—the physics of drag is hidden in thisfunction
" For a given object type—such as a sphere of a given material—experimentsshow a remarkable feature: The drag coefficient only depends on one number, Re,called the Reynold’s number:C D (v, η, ρ, d) = C D (Re) , Re = ρdη v "
 (5
22)This is a surprisingly compact description with many interesting implications
" Forexample, if you increase the velocity by a factor 10 you get the same drag coefficientif you either reduce the radius by a factor 10 or increase the viscosity by a factor 10"
"The general function for the drag coefficient, C D (Re), for a smooth sphere is shownin Fig"
 5
8
 (You can find the data-set for part (a) in cdreynolds
d 5 )
"For small velocities, we expect to recover Stokes’ general result: F D = 6πηRv,which implies that C D (Re) ∝ Re−1 for small v (and Re)"
 This is indeed what weobserve in Fig
 5
"8, where Re−1 is shown as a straight line"
" For large velocities,we see that the drag coefficient becomes approximately constant, and the force istherefore proportional to the square of the velocity"
" Our simplified models for smalland large velocities are therefore consistent with the experimental results, and we5 http://folk"

Something strange happens when the Reynold’s number reaches Re = 3
2 ×10 5 : The drag coefficient drops significantly! A careful calculation (which you canprogram yourself) shows that not only the drag coefficient but also the fluid dragforce falls
 How can the drag force decrease when the velocity increases? This effectis due to boundary-layer turbulence (which we will not explain here)
 The transitionpoint where this effect kicks in depends on surface properties of the object
" For arough surface, such as that of a golf ball, the transition occurs for a lower Reynoldsnumber than for a smooth ball"
 This is the reason why golf balls have a rough surface:The air drag force for large velocities is reduced by this design
What happened to aerodynamic design? This is also hidden in the drag coefficient
"The value of the drag coefficient depends on the shape of the object, and moreaerodynamic designs have lower drag coefficients for approximately the same cross-sectional area, as illustrated in Fig"

" For the air resistance F D we assume that wecan use the viscous law:FD = −k v v(t) j , (5"
23)where v(t) is the velocity of the drop
 You should check with yourself that this forceindeed has the correct sign
 Remember that when the drop falls downward its velocityis negative
"Newton’s second law: We apply Newton’s second law to find the acceleration of thedrop:Fnet = FD + G = −mg j − k v v(t) j = ma j , (5"
24)which corresponds to− mg − k v v(t) = ma 
 (5
25)We lack two of the numbers in this equation: m and k v
 We can find the mass of thedrop by assuming that it is spherical and made of water
" The volume of a sphere isV = (4π/3)r3 , where r = d/2 is the radius of the sphere, and the mass density ofwater is ρ = 1000"

 The mass of the drop is thereforem = ρ V = ρ 4π3 r3 = ρ 4π3( d2)3= 5

26)We find k v from Stokes’ formula in (5

 The radius of the raindropis r = 0

 Thisgives k v = 1

"6 Force Model: Viscous Force 101Finally, to calculate the motion of the drop, we need to know its initial conditions:It starts from y(0) = h at t = 0 s at rest, that is, with v(0) = 0 m/s"
"Simplified model: No air resistance: First, what happens in the simplified case whenwe have no air resistance? In that case, k v = 0, and the acceleration is a constanta = −g "
 (5
27)We find the velocity as function of time by direct integration:v(t) − v(0) =∫ t0a dt = −gt 
 (5
"28)This corresponds to a free fall, as we have seen previously"
" We expect this to onlybe a good approximation as long as the air resistance term is small, that is as long ask v v(t) is much smaller than mg, that is whenk v v  mg ⇒ v  mgk v= 5"

29)We will check how good this approximation is further on
"Simplified model: Constant velocity: What will happen as the drop starts to fall? Itstarts from zero velocity, hence the initial acceleration will be a = −g − (k v/m)v =−g"
" As the drop falls, the velocity becomes a negative number, but with increasingmagnitude"
" The acceleration, a = −g − (k v/m)v will therefore approach zero"
"However, if the acceleration becomes zero, the velocity will no longer change, andthe drop will have reached a stationary velocity—a velocity that does not changewith time"
 This occurs whena = −g − k vm v = 0 ⇒ −g = k vm v ⇒ v = − mgk v
 (5
"30)We call this velocity the terminal velocity, v T :v T = mgk v"
 (5
31)We therefore expect the drop to approach the velocity v = −v T as time increases
"Full model: Numerical solution: We now know both the initial behavior, a = −g,and the asymptotic behavior, a → 0 m/s 2 , v → −v T "
" We can find the velocity bysolvinga = dvdt = −g − k vm v , (5"

 We see that both v(t) and a(t) behaves as we expected
 The drop startswith zero velocity and an initial acceleration of −g
 The acceleration reduces asthe velocity increases and the drop reaches a stationary state where it moves withconstant velocity
 We compare with the two simplified models

 In yourcareer as a physicist it is therefore more important to be able to formulate problemsso that they can be solved numerically or symbolically than to be able to solve themanalytically yourself

7 Force Model: Spring ForceThe two most common contact forces for a macroscopic object are due to• contact with a fluid or• contact with another solid
We have seen that we can use a velocity-dependent force to model fluid-solid contacts
"What about solid-solid contacts? The contact forces between two solid objects comefrom the deformation of the objects (and from surface forces such as adhesion andfriction, but we will address such effects later)"
" How can we model contact forcesdue to deformation?Spring ForceFirst, we can measure the force due to deformation directly"

"12 Illustration of a stiff spring (1) and a weak spring (2) extended by the same length ΔL(on the left), and affected by the same force F (on the right)Why do we call this force a spring force? Because a coiled spring is constructedso that the deformation force is proportional to the extension ΔL also for largeextensions"
 Coiled springs are commonly used in experimental demonstrations andin many mechanical devices
" Here, we usually base our discussions on the behaviorof a spring, but keep in mind that the results are valid for the deformation of anyobject as long as the deformation is small compared to the size of the object"
"Spring constant, k : The constant k is called the spring constant, which is the slopeof the F(ΔL) curve"
 Figure 5
12 shows the behavior for a weak spring (1) and fora stiff spring (2)
" The stiff spring has a larger spring constant than the weak spring,k2 > k1 "
"If we want both springs to extend the same length ΔL, we need to apply a largerforce to the stiffer spring than to the weaker spring: F2 > F1 (see left side in figure)"
"If we apply the same force to both springs, the weak spring extends further thanthe stiff spring: ΔL1 > ΔL2 (see right side in figure)"
" This is consistent with ourintuition: If we pull with the same force on a rubber band and on a stiff rope, therubber band deforms more than the rope"
 Hence the rubber band has a smaller springconstant than the rope
The spring constant characterizes a particular object
" If we redo the experimentwith the same spring, we find the same spring constant every time"
"106 5 Forces in One DimensionElongation, ΔL: A physical object such as a spring has a non-zero length when itis not stretched"
" We call this length the equilibrium length, L0 , of the spring"
" Theelongation of the spring is the difference between the length of the spring, L, and theequilibrium length L0 :ΔL = L − L0 "
 (5
41)Various elongations are illustrated in Fig
 5
12
" If the spring is stretched, ΔL ispositive"
" We usually assume that a spring can be also compressed, even if this maynot be physically realistic"
" (You cannot really compress a rope, it will buckle instead)"
"For a compressed spring, the length of the spring is smaller than the equilibriumlength, and ΔL is negative"
Sign: You have to determine the sign in front of kΔL in (5
40) using your physicalintuition
" It is not that difficult: All you have to remember is that in order to extendthe spring, you need to pull at the spring in the direction you extend it"
Spring-Block ModelsWe now know that the force required to extend a spring a length ΔL is F = kΔL
How can we use this to determine the motion of an object attached to a spring? InFig
 5
"13, we have illustrated two general cases: A block attached to a spring, and aball in contact with a spring"
" Both objects slide on a frictionless surface, so that thereare no other horizontal forces: The only horizontal force acting on the block (ball)is from the spring"
"A Block Attached to a SpringThe force, F, on the block from the spring is the same as the force acting on thespring from the block, but it has the opposite direction"
" (Later, when we introduceNewton’s third law, we see that these forces are action-reaction pairs"
)F(ΔL) = −kΔL 
 (5
"42)The sign is chosen so that when the spring is extended—it is longer than inequilibrium—the force is negative, that it, the force acts in the negative x-direction"
"We describe the position of the block by the position, x, of the left-hand side ofthe block, where it is attached to the spring"
 The other end of the spring is attachedto a wall at x = 0
" The extension of the spring depends on the position of the block:ΔL = L − L0 , (5"
43)where L = (x − 0) = x is the length of the spring

"13 Illustration of the force on a block attached to a spring (left), and on a ball colliding with(but not attached to) a spring (right)The force F on the block consequently depends on the position of the block:F = F(x) = −k (x − L0) "
 (5
44)The spring force acting on an object attached to the spring is therefore anexample of a position-dependent force
Why is it important if a force is position-dependent? Because this means that theposition occurs on both sides of the equation of motion following from Newton’ssecond law:F = ma ⇒ a = d2 xdt2 = − km (x − L0) 
 (5
45)We need to solve a differential equation to determine the motion of the block
"108 5 Forces in One DimensionThis also illustrates another important lesson: If the force model includes variablesthat change during motion, we need to rewrite the force model to include the positionof the object"
 A common mistake is to stop at (5
"42), where the force, F(L), dependson the length L, and not realize that L is a function of the position, L = L(x), andthat the equation must be solved as a differential equation"
A Ball Colliding with a SpringThe ball in Fig
 5
13 is not attached to the spring—it is not glued to the spring asthe block was
" The ball is therefore only affected by the spring force as long as thespring is compressed, that is, when ΔL < 0"
" We must rewrite the force model toreflect this:F(ΔL) ={ −kΔL , ΔL < 00 , ΔL ≥ 0 (5"
"46)The rest of the analysis is exactly the same as for the ball: The spring force is positiondependent, and can be written as:F(ΔL) ={ −k (x − L0) , x < L00 , x ≥ L0 (5"
47)Notice that this force model is non-linear and the problem therefore requires specialconsideration when you solve it: You must remember that the force is zero as soonas the ball loses contact with the spring
Notice also that the ball-spring contact is a lot like the normal force
 This is nota coincidence
" The spring-ball model is actually our simplest model for the normalforce, as we discuss in the following section, and the spring-block model is thesimplest model for a contact force between two attached objects"
 These are probablythe models you will use the most during your physics studies
Contact ForcesThe spring force was introduced as an approximative model for the force due todeformation
 It is based on experimental evidence: We find the law by measuringthe force as a function of the deformation
 And the law is surprisingly versatile: Wecan use it as a model for almost any contact force between solid objects
" Let us seeexactly how we map a complicated, realistic deformation problem onto the simplifiedspring model description"
Figure 5
"14 shows a computer simulation of a collision between a soft, round diskand a solid wall that does not deform"
" The top figures show the deformation of theball, where the colors indicate the magnitude of the forces inside the disk"
" During thecollision, the ball is deformed, but how do we measure the extent of deformation?The simplest approach is to look at how much the ball has changed from its original,5"

" This measurement of ΔL is illustrated in the bottom figures, where wesee that the original shape overlaps with the wall, and we define ΔL as the length ofthis overlap"
" The middle figure shows the force from the wall on the ball as a functionof deformation, ΔL, and it is indeed a linear function, F = kΔL, as we found for aspring!We can therefore use the spring model as a model for the deformation of a ball, oras a first approximation for the deformation of any deforming object"
 In this case wesay that we use the spring model as an approximative model for the contact force
In the bottom of Fig
 5
14 we illustrate that we model the contact between the diskand the floor by representing the disk as a mass located at the center of the sphereconnected to a massless spring of length L0 = R equal to the radius of the sphere
We may also express the force in terms of the position x of the center of the ball
"We notice that the spring is compressed, ΔL = L − L0 = x − R < 0, duringthe collision, and we expect the force on the ball to act upward while the ball iscompressed, hence:F = −kΔL = −k (x − R) , (5"
48)is the force on the ball from the wall
"110 5 Forces in One DimensionGenerally, we do not know what the spring constant will be for such a model"
We need either to measure the spring constant or to find the spring constant froma theoretical consideration based on for example elasticity theory
 You must alsoensure that you use a reasonable version of the spring model
" For example, for thecollision between a ball and a wall in Fig"
 5
"14, where the ball does not adhere to thewall, we must use a spring-ball model without attachment"
"We can use the spring model both when the object itself is deformed, as illustratedin Fig"
 5
"14, as well as when the wall deforms while the ball remains practicallyundeformed—a steel ball bouncing on a mattress, or when both the ball and the walldeforms"
"Test your understanding: How would you represent the force between an undeformable ball anda deformable surface? Make a drawing, and show how you introduce the spring that models thedeformation"
Normal and Contact ForcesThe force from the wall on the ball is the normal force on the ball
" However, a normalforce only acts as long as the objects are in contact"
"We can model a normal force between two objects using a spring model:F ={ kΔL while in contact0 otherwise , (5"
49)where ΔL describes the deformation of the two objects
For the ball in Fig
 5
"14 the normal force F is:F ={ −k(x − R) , x < R0 , x ≥ R "
 (5
"50)We can use this force model to find the motion of a bouncing ball if we also include theeffect of gravity, G = mg"
 (We assume air resistance is negligible)
" The accelerationis then found from:a = 1m Fnet = F − G , (5"
51)and the resulting motion is illustrated in Fig
 5
15
The normal force only acts when two objects are pressed together
" On the otherhand, if the objects are attached to each other, the contact force acts both when theobjects are pressed together and when they are pulled apart"
" Examples of attachedobjects are: two objects that are glued or welded together or attached by surfaceforces such as adhesion, two parts of one larger solid body such as the two lobes ona dumbbell, or two atoms in a diatomic molecule"

"52)where ΔL represents the elongation of the contact, which is typically equal tothe change in distance between the centers of the two objects in contact"
General Position-Dependent ForceThe spring model is not only a model for the deformation of springs
" It is an extremelyversatile model that provides a good description of the deformation of almost anyobject, spanning length scales from the deformation of the Earth’s surface to thedeformation of objects only a few atom diameters in size"
" It describes the deformationof rubber bands, strings, wires, wheels, bars, and the interactions between moleculesand atoms"
" However, the spring model is typically only valid for small deformations:the deformation should be small compared to the size of the system"
The spring model is probably the most powerful and common model for interac-tions that you will encounter in physics
" Why is that? Because many types of forcesdepend on the position of an object relative to another object: Contact forces, grav-itational forces, electromagnetic forces, and inter-atomic forces all depend on the112 5 Forces in One Dimensionposition, x, of the object they act on: F = F(x)"
" For motion near a point x = b, wecan approximate the force on the object with Taylor’s formula for F(x):F(x) = F(b) + F′(b)(x − b) + O(x − b)2 "
 (5
"53)The force on the object at a position x near b, that is when (x − b) is small, can beapproximated by the first order term:F(x)  F(b) + F′(b)(x − b) "
 (5
54)This force model has the same form as the contact force model in (5
50) except forthe constant F(b)
" However, in most cases we measure the displacement from anequilibrium position where no force is acting and therefore F(b) = 0"
"The spring model corresponds to a Taylor expansion of a position-dependentforce F(x) around an equilibrium point, b:F(x)  F′(b) (x − b) = k (x − b) (5"
55)where k = F′(b)
"For example, for the ball in contact with the wall in Fig"

"14, the deformation ofthe ball is small, and we can use the spring model as an approximation to the realdeformation force"

"1 Example: Motion of a Hanging BlockThis example demonstrates how we can find the motion of an object affected by aspring force, using both numerical and analytical methods"
 The methods introducedcan be applied to find the behavior of an object subject to any type of position-dependent force
A block of mass m = 1 kg is hanging from a spring with spring constant k =100 N/m
 The other end of the spring is attached to the ceiling
" We apply the structuredproblem-solving approach to find the motion of the block after it is released, and thenmake the model more realistic by adding air resistance"

 (5

" Since the block does not move, air resistance is zero,F D = 0, and the acceleration is also zero, which gives:− ky + F D − mg = −ky − mg = ma = 0 , (5"

"What would you expect to happen if you instead released the block from a positionabove this equilibrium position? We would expect the block to oscillate, but the oscil-lations would grow smaller, and the block would eventually stop at the equilibrumposition"
" Does our model system reproduce this behavior?Simplified model—No air resistance: We start from a simplified model, where weassume that air resistance is negligible, so that F D = 0"

" Generally, we advice you to use a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for oscillator problems, but we use Euler-Cromer here to make theprogramming transparent"

"In this case, the time step must be much smaller than time it takes for the block toswing back a forth one time, otherwise the results will not make any sense"
" However,it is a good rule to check your results by reducing your time-step by a factor 10 andobserving if your solution is stable to such a change"
While the resulting motion is illustrated in the plots in Fig

" Since yeq is a constant, this doesnot change the second derivative with respect to time:d2udt2 = d2 ydt2 = − (k/m) u , (5"
65)where the initial conditions now are u(0) = y(0)−yeq = −yeq and du/dt (0) = v(0)
Finding an analytical solution means finding a function y(t) that satisfies (5

" If we have found one such function, we can be sure this isthe solution, because there is a uniqueness theorem in the mathematics of ordinarydifferential equations"
"What functions become minus themselves after being derived twice? You mayknow (if you have already learned this trick), that this is true for the trigonometricfunctions sin and cos"
 The general solution to (5

" Eventually, it will become a natural part of yourknowledge base"
)Simplified model—Symbolic solution: You can solve (5
62) using the symbolicpackage in Python
" First, you need to define all the relavant variables in the problem,where we introduce q = k/m for simplicity:>> from sympy import *>> y = Function(’y’)>> from sympy"
abc import t>> from sympy
abc import g>> from sympy
"abc import qThen, we solve the differential equation, which includes the second derivative of y(t),which is written as Derivative(y(t),t,2)"
" In addition, we need to providethe initial conditions at both y(0) = y0 and dy/dt (0) = 0"
" To solve the equation, weneed to rewrite it so that the right hand side consists of a zero:d2 ydt2 = −g − q y ⇒ d2 ydt2 + g + q y = 0 "
 (5
"70)We can then use dsolve to find the analytical solution:>> dsolve(Derivative(y(t),t,2)+g+q*y(t),y(t))y(t) == -g/q + (C1*sin(t*Abs((re(q)**2 + im(q)**2)**(1/4)*"



"Ooops! This is the correct result, but it is in a form which you may not recognize,unless you have some experience with complex numbers"
 The key lies in the sign ofq
" In our case, q is a positive number, but we have not told the symbolic solver this"
"We can redefine q and try again:>> q = Symbol(’q’, real=True, positive=True)>> dsolve(Derivative(y(t),t,2)+g+q*y(t),y(t))y(t) == C1*sin(sqrt(q)*t) + C2*cos(sqrt(q)*t) - g/qThis result was much simpler to interpret! This is indeed the answer we found pre-viously, we only need to substitute the correct initial conditions, just like we didabove"
"Simplified model—Analysis: The solution we have found so far show an everlasting,oscillating motion:y(t) = (mg/k) cos (ωt) − (mg/k) "
 (5
71)The block oscillates up and down with a period T = 2π/ω
" However, this is not whatwe would expect in a realistic situation, where we expect the motion to be dampedand that the block eventually comes to rest"
 We can study one way this may happenby introducing air resistance

"7 Force Model: Spring Force 119Full model—Numerical solution: Now, we assume that the block also is affectedby a non-negligible air resistance force, F D described by an advanced model forair resistance: At large velocities the air resistance force is described by a quadraticlaw with drag coefficient D = 0"
"15 m−1 , and at low velocities it is described by aviscous drag force with drag constant k v"
 We assume that the transition occurs atvt = 0
"01 m/s:F D (v) ={ −Dv(t)|v(t)| , v > vt−k v v(t) , v < vt (5"

"This gives us a force model for F D and we can find the motion of the block using anumerical scheme such as Euler-Cromer, as implemented in the following program"

"8 Newton’s First LawWhat happens if the net external force on a body is zero? Applying Newton’s secondlaw, we find:Fnet = 0 = ma ⇒ a = dvdt = 0 "
 (5
"74)The acceleration is zero, which means that the velocity of the object is constant"
 Thisis often referred to as Newton’s first law:Newton’s first law: An object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain inthat state unless an external force changes its state of motion
"Why do we need a separate law for this? Is it not simply a special case of Newton’ssecond law? Yes, Newton’s first law can be deduced from the second law as we haveillustrated"
" However, the first law is often used for a different purpose: Newton’sFirst Law tells us about the limit of applicability of Newton’s Second law"
 Newton’sSecond law can only be used in reference systems where the First law is obeyed
 Butis not the First law always valid? No! The First law is only valid in reference systemsthat are not accelerated
" If you observe the motion of a ball from an acceleratingcar, the ball will appear to accelerate even if there are no forces acting on it"
" We callsystems that are not accelerating inertial systems, and Newton’s first law is oftencalled the law of inertia"
 Newton’s first and second laws of motion are only valid ininertial systems
 We will discuss references systems and inertial systems in detailwhen we discuss motion in two and three dimensions in Chap
 6
"A system is an inertial system if it is not accelerated—that is, the reference systemmust not be accelerating linearly or rotating"
" Unfortunately, this means that mostsystems we know are not really inertial systems"
" For example, the surface of theEarth is clearly not an inertial system, because the Earth is rotating"
 The Earth is also5
"8 Newton’s First Law 121not an inertial system, because it is moving in a curved path around the Sun"
" However,even if the surface of the Earth is not strictly an inertial system, it may be consideredto be approximately an inertial system for many laboratory-size experiments"
5
"9 Newton’s Third LawSo far, we have studied the motion of a single object by considering the interactionsbetween the object (the system) and the environment (everything else)"
 But mostproblems we deal with include an interplay between several objects
 How can weaddress such systems?We already started to address systems with several components when we addressedforces between a system and its environment
" When you press your finger towardthe table, you experience a force, and the table experiences a force"
" How are theseforces related?First, we realize that they act on different objects"
" There is a force from the fingeron the table, and a force from the table on the finger"
" If the finger is the system, thereis a contact force on the finger from the table, which is in the environment"
" On theother hand, if the table is the system, there is a contact force on the table from thefinger, which is the environment in this case"
Could we get around this by introducing a more precise description of the inter-action between the table and the finger? We argued that the top of the table is reallynot flat but rather rough on a microscopic scale—its surface consists of microscopicbumps
" When I press my finger on the table, I press onto these small bumps, so thatthe bumps are deformed, and the bumps push down on the table"
" However, when myfinger pushes toward the bumps, there is still a force from the finger on the bumpsand a force from the bumps on my finger"
" Similarly, the bumps press down on therest of the table, and the rest of the table pushes up on the bumps"
"We realize that all forces, all interactions between objects, come in pairs"
" If thereis a force from object A on object B, there is also a force from object B on object A"
This fundamental principle of interactions is called Newton’s third law
 We do notknow of any force that do not obey this law: All forces appear in pairs
 Newton’sthird law is usually formulated as:Newton’s third law of motion: For every action there is an equal and oppositereaction
This is a classical formulation of Newton’s third law
 The words “action” and “reac-tion” here means force and counter-force
" If you push with your finger (F) on the table(T), there is a force, an action, Ffrom F on T , from the finger on the table"
" Typically wewrite this by subindicies:122 5 Forces in One DimensionFfrom F on T , (5"
75)for the force from F on T
Newton’s third law then states that there is an equal and oppositely directed forcefrom the table on the finger
" That is:Ffrom T on F = −Ffrom F on T , (5"
76)It is important to realize that the two forces in the force-pair act on different objects
Application of Newton’s Third LawLet us introduce and apply Newton’s third law through a simple example
" We addressa two crates lying on top of each other on the ground, as illustrated in Fig"

20a
" Thesystem consists of three bodies: the top crate (A), the bottom crate (B), and the ground(E)"
" The ground is really the whole Earth, and we therefore use the symbol (E)"

 Various steps in the process of designingthe free-body diagram are illustrated5
"9 Newton’s Third Law 123Drawing a free-body diagram for a compound system:Follow these steps to find and identify all the forces acting on an each object,and then to draw the free-body diagram for each of the objects the system"
• Draw each object as separate systems
"• Find all forces on all objects, and draw them as vectors"
• Express the forces as FA on B 
• Identify action-reaction pairs
"• Check that every force has a unique reaction, and that they act on differentobjects"
 Draw in the axes of the coordinate system
1
 Draw all objects as separate systems
 This is done in Fig
 5
20b
" We draw thesystems apart, so that we have room to fill in more details such as forces andcoordinate systems for the various systems"
2
" Find all forces on all objects, and draw them as vectors"
 This is done inFig
 5
20c
" For each object, we find where it is in contact with other objects,or with the environment, and draw in the contact forces"
" Finally, we add thelong-range forces"
" Here, the only long-range force is gravity"
" Note that gravityacts between all the objects, but we have only included the gravitational forcesbetween the Earth and each of the two crates, since the gravitational force betweenthe two crates are negligible"
3
 Express the forces as Ffrom A on B 
" For each of the forces we find what object it isacting on, and in what object the force has it origin"
 This is shown in Fig
 5
20d
4
 Identify action-reaction pairs
 We draw a dotted line between each action-reaction pair
" All force in our figure should have an origin either in one of theother objects, or in the environment"
" For clarity, we have placed the gravitationalforce from the crate on the Earth, in a point close to the surface of the Earth"
" Inreality, these forces act in the center of the Earth"
 We have illustrated this processin Fig
 5
20e5
" Check that every force has a unique reaction, and that they act on differentobjects"
 Draw in the axes of the coordinate system
The result of this analysis is a free-body diagram for each of the objects
 The pro-posed method is elaborate
 You may argue that it is too elaborate
" As you becomeexperienced, you no longer need to be this rigorous in your approach"
" An expertwould draw the free-body diagram directly, but would still recognize action-reactionpairs in the drawing, even though he will probably not mark them"
"When you become more experienced in recognizing action-reaction pairs, youmay also exclude The Earth from the drawing in Fig"
 5
20e
" Instead, you will drawtwo objects, and consider everything outside the two objects to be the environment"
"You can do this, because you are typically not interested in the motion of the Earth,but only the motion and in the forces on the two crates"
" In this case, you will havetwo types of forces in your drawing of one of the objects: either a force has itsorigin in one of the other objects, in this case your free-body diagrams include the124 5 Forces in One Dimensionaction-reaction pair, or a force has its origin in the environment"
 This is illustrated inFig
 5
20f
" Here, the two gravitational forces on the two crates, and the normal forceon the lower crate, all have their origin in the environment, and their reactions aretherefore not included in the figure"
One of the most common mistakes when applying Newton’s third law is to assignan incorrect action-reaction pair
" For example, it is common to assign the normalforce Ffrom B on A to be the reaction force to Gfrom E on A in Fig"
 5
20d
" Such an errorcan be spotted in two ways: First, the action-reaction pair in this case acts on thesame object"
 They must always act on different objects according to Newton’s thirdlaw
" Second, the two forces are due to quite different mechanisms and contacts"
" Forcontact forces, the action and reaction forces act in the same point"
" For long-rangeforces, the action-reaction pair is due to the same type of interaction between thetwo objects"
 In Fig
 5
20d the reaction force to the gravity from the Earth on crate Amust therefore also be a gravitational force and also between the same two objects
"Structured Approach to Compound ProblemsWith the addition of Newton’s third law, we now have sufficient tools to address theforces between objects in problems with several moving components"
 We call suchsystems compound systems
 Solving problems with several components are not morecomplicated than solving problems with just a single object—we simply apply thestructured problem-solving approach to each of the objects

"1 Example: Weight in an ElevatorIn this example you learn to analyze problems with several bodies, using Newton’sthird law to relate force pairs, and apply Newton’s second law to find the motion ofeach body in the system"
Problem: A person of mass m is standing in an elevator of mass M
 The person isstanding on spring-weight with negligible mass and spring constant k
 Find the forceshown by the weight and the force in the wire if both the elevator and the person ismoving with a constant acceleration a
 Discuss what really happens as the elevatorstarts moving from rest
Our plan is to find the forces acting on each object and use Newton’s secondlaw to find the acceleration of each object
" If all objects are moving with the sameacceleration, we can use this to find the forces between the object"
" In the second partthe objects do not necessarily have the same acceleration, and we need to introduceforce models for the internal forces to relate the positions"
"Sketch and identify: In this problem we are studying the motion of the elevator(E), the weight (W), and person (P) as illustrated in Fig"

"21, described by thecorresponding positions, x E (t), x W (t), and x P (t)"

 5
21)
" The elevator is affected by the external force T from the wire,the contact force NW on E from the weight, gravity, G E = m E g"
 The weight is affectedby the contact force NE on W from the elevator and the contact force NP on W fromthe person
" The gravitational force is negligible, G W = 0"
" The person is affected bythe contact force NW on P from the weight and by gravity, G P = m P g"
" We noticethat the contact forces NE on W and NW on E are action-reaction pairs, and similarlyfor NP on W and NE on W "
" We apply Newton’s second law in the vertical direction foreach object:Elevator: ∑jF j,E = T − NW on E − G E = m E a E "
 (5
"77)Weight: ∑jF j,W = NE on W − NP on W = m W︸︷︷︸=0a W = 0 "
 (5
"78)Person: ∑jF j,P = NW on P − G P = m P a P "
 (5
79)Notice that the directions of the forces are included in the choice of signs
 This meansthat NW on P is the magnitude of this contact force
" Newton’s third law thereforegives that NW on P = NP on W = N P , where we have written N P for simplicity, andsimilarly NW on E = NE on W = N E "
"Simplified model—No motion: First, let us address the case where the elevator isnot moving"
" In this case all the accelerations are zero, and we find from (5"
79) thatNW on P − G P = m P a P = 0 ⇒ N P = G P 
 (5
"80)126 5 Forces in One DimensionSince what we read from the weight is the normal force applied to the weight, thismeans that we can read the gravitational force on the person from the weight, whichis what we call the weight of the person!The force, T , from the wire can be found from (5"
"77):T − NW on E − G E = m E a E = 0 , (5"
"81)which givesT = N E + G E , (5"
82)where (5
"78) always gives N E = N P , which we combine with N P = G P , getting:T = N E + G E = G E + G P = (m E + m P ) g "
 (5
"83)When the system is at rest, the force from the wire is equal to the sum of the gravi-tational forces"
"Simplified model—No relative motion: Second, we assume that the elevator, theweight, and the person do not move relative to each other"
" They will therefore havethe same acceleration, a E = a W = a P = a"
" In this case, the weight still displays thecontact force N P , but this force is now given by (5"
"79), which gives:N P = G P + m P a P = m P g + m P a = m P (a + g) "
 (5
84)So the number you read on the weight is larger if the elevator is accelerating upward
"Full model—Force models: Finally, what happens if we open for the possibility thatthe objects move relative to each other? As the elevator starts to move, the weightstarts to compress, increasing the force on the person, until the person starts moving,changing the compression in the spring in the weight, and so on"
 We must “Solve”to find the motion of each of the objects based on force models for the interactions
We can still use (5
"77), since the mass of the weight is negligible, which means thatN E = N P = N , and the forces acting on each end of the spring are the same!How do we model the contact force N ? It depends on the compression of thespring inside the weight"
 Let us describe the position of each side of the weight
" Ifwe describe the motion of the person by the position of her feet, they are in contactwith the top of the weight, and the position of the top of the weight is therefore x P (t)"
"Similarly, we can describe the position of the elevator by the position of the pointwhere the weight is in contact with the elevator, so that the bottom of the weight isat x E (t)"
" The change in the extension of the spring inside the weight is thereforeΔL = L − L0 = x P − x E − L0 , (5"
85)where L0 is the equilibrium distance between the top and bottom of the weight
" Theweight is compressed by the contact force, N , which is given as a spring force:5"
9 Newton’s Third Law 127N = ±kΔL (5
86)where we must choose the sign to ensure that a compressive force must be applied tocompress the spring
 The normal force must be positive if the spring is compressed
For compression ΔL < 0
" The sign must therefore be negative to ensure a positivecontact force:N = −kΔL = −k (x P − x E − L0) , (5"
"87)Notice that the contact force cannot be negative, since the person is not glued to theweight"
" A weight can push, but not pull, on a person standing on it"
"Full model—Newton’s second law: Finally, we have a force model for the contactforces, and we can use Newton’s second law to find equations for the positions ofthe person and the elevator"
 Newton’s second law for the elevator from (5
"77) gives:T − N − G E = m E a E , (5"
88)and similarly Newton’s second law for the person from (5
"79) gives:N − G P = m P a P , (5"
89)where N from (5
87) is a function of both x E and x P 
"We can rewrite these equations as:a E = d2 x Edt2 = 1m E(T + k (x P − x E − L0) − m E g) , (5"
90)a P = d2 x Pdt2 = 1m P(−k (x P − x E − L0) − m P g) 
 (5
"91)While these differential equations may seem daunting, they are not that difficultto solve analytically (but we will not do that here), and they are simple to solvenumerically (which we will do here)"
Full model—Initial conditions: What are the initial conditions? We know that theperson and elevator are starting from rest
 Then an additional force F was addedto the elevator
" Since they are starting from rest, we know that the initial velocitiesare zero: v E (t0) = 0 m/s and v P (t0) = 0 m/s"
 What about the initial positions? Weknow that initially the person is standing on the weight
 The weight must thereforebe compressed
" We find the compression from Newton’s second law for the person,in the case where the acceleration is zero:a P (t0) = −k (x P (t0) − x E (t0) − L0) − m P g = 0 , (5"
"92)128 5 Forces in One Dimensionwhich givesx P (t0) = x E (t0) + L0 − m P gk , (5"
93)where we are free to choose the coordinate system so that x E (t0) = 0 m
Notice that the elevator was started by adding a force F to the tension T alreadyin the wire when the system is at rest
" We find the initial value for T from Newton’ssecond law for the elevator in the case where the acceleration is zero:a E (t0) = T + k (x P − x E − L0) − m E g = 0 , (5"
94)where (5
"92) gives k (x P − x E − L0) = m P g, which inserted in (5"
94) gives:T = m E g + m P g = (m E + m P )g 
 (5
"95)This is not surprising: At rest, the force T from the wire must balance the totalgravitational force on the elevator with the person, T = G P + G E , just as we foundabove"
" And the result would be the same if we assumed the elevator, weight, andperson to be a single object with mass M = m E + m P "
"Full model—Numerical solution: While this problem can be solved analytically,the numerical solution and discussion is simpler, and provides the most essentialinsights into the process"
 We therefore apply Euler-Cromer’s method to find thepositions and velocities of the person and the elevator starting from t = t0 = 0
0 s
The method is implemented in the following program:from numpy import *The positions x E and x P are compared with the positions found using the accelerationof the whole system found previously:a = T − (m E + m P )gm E + m P
 (5
96)The resulting behavior is shown in Fig
 5
22
 We see that the position of the personon the weight oscillates around the stationary solution
" The position of the elevatoralso oscillates, but the oscillations are much smaller and are therefore not visible onthis plot"
"Analysis: What we read off the weight is the spring force, which is:N = −k (x P − x E − L0) (5"
97)The spring force is plotted as a function of time in Fig

Such a behavior is to be expected in a real system,but there will also be additional forces that will tend to reduce the oscillations, sothat after a few oscillations, the weight will stop at the expected value, F = 823"
"2 NSummaryNewton’s second law:• Newton’s second law relates the acceleration of an object to the net forces actingon it: ∑j F j = ma, where the sum is over all forces acting on the object, and mis the inertial mass"
• All forces acting on a system has a source in the environment
• Forces can be contact forces acting on the boundary between the system and theenvironment
• Forces can be long range forces from an object in the environment
"• Forces are drawn as vectors starting at the point where the force is acting, pointingin the direction of the force, and with a length indicating the length of the force"
"• The force may be a given quantity, F"
130 5 Forces in One Dimension• The gravitational force acts between all objects
" On the surface of the Earth thegravitational force on an object is W = −mg j, where j is a unit vector pointingupward, g is the acceleration of gravity, and m is the gravitational mass"
 Thegravitational mass is equal to the inertial mass
• The contact force from a fluid on a moving object depends on the velocity ofthe object relative to the fluid
" The simplest force model is the viscous force,D = −k vv, where the constant k v depends on the viscosity of the fluid and the sizeof the object"
• The contact force from a solid depends on the distance between the object and thesolid
" The simplest force model is the spring force, F = −kΔL i"
" Where ΔL is theelongation, and k is the spring constant which gives the stiffness of the contact"
The spring model is one of the most fundamental force models because it is thefirst order Taylor expansion of any position-dependent force
Problem-solving approach:• We identify the object and its initial conditions
"• We model the behavior by find the forces acting on the object, introducing forcemodels for all the forces, and applying Newton’s second law to find an equationfor the acceleration of the object"
• We solve the problem by finding the position and velocity from the accelerationand the initial conditions using numerical or analytical techniques
"• We analyze the solution to validate it, and use the solution to answer the originalquestion posed"

Projects5
29 Modeling a 100 m race
 In this project we will develop an advanced modelfor the motion of a sprinter during a 100 m race
" We will build the model gradually,adding complications one at a time to develop a realistic model for the race"
(a) A sprinter is accelerating along the track
" Draw a free-body diagram of the sprinter,including only horizontal forces"
 Try to make the length of the vectors correspondto the relative magnitudes of the forces
"Let us assume that the sprinter is accelerated by a constant horizontal drivingforce, F = 400 N, from the ground all the way from the start to the 100 m line(averaged over a few steps)"
 The mass of the sprinter is m = 80 kg
"(b) Find the position, x(t), of the sprinter as a function of time"
(c) Show that the sprinter uses t = 6
3 s to reach the 100 m line
This is a bit fast compared with real races
" However, real sprinters are limited byair resistance"
 Let us introduce a model for air resistance by assuming that the airresistance force is described by a square law:D = (1/2)ρC D A(v − w)2 (5
"98)where ρ is the density of air, A is the cross-sectional area of the runner, C D is thedrag coefficient, v is the velocity of the runner, and w is the velocity of the air"
 Atsea level ρ = 1
"293 kg/m 3 , and for the runner we can assume A = 0"
"45 m 2 , andC D = 1"
2
 You can initially assume that there is no wind: w = 0 m/s
"Assume that the runner is only affected by the constant driving force, F, and theair resistance force, D"
(d) Find an expression for the acceleration of the runner
"(e) Use Euler’s method to find the velocity, v(t), and position, x(t) as a function oftime for the runner"
 The runner starts from rest at the time t = 0s
" Plot the position,velocity and acceleration of the runner as a function of time"
 How did you decideon the time-step Δt? (Your answer should include the program used to solve theproblem and the resulting plots)
(f) Use the results to find the race time for the 100 m race
136 5 Forces in One Dimension(g) Show that the (theoretical) maximum velocity of a runner driven by these forces is:v T = √2F/ (ρ C D A) 
 (5
99)The runner may have to run more than 100 m to reach this velocity
" (We often call thismaximum velocity the terminal velocity—“terminal” because the velocity increasesuntil it reaches the terminal velocity, where the acceleration becomes zero)"
 Find thenumerical value of the terminal velocity for the runner
 Do you think this is realistic?So far the model only includes a constant driving force and air resistance
 This isclearly a too simplified model to be realistic
 Let us make the model more realisticby adding a few features
"First, there is a physiological limit to how fast you can run"
" The driving forcefrom the runner should therefore decrease with velocity, so that there is a maximumvelocity at which the acceleration is zero even without air resistance"
" While we do notknow the detailed physiological mechanisms for this effect, we can make a simplifiedforce model to implement the effect by introducing a driving force, F D , with twoterms: a constant term, F, and a term that decreases with increasing velocity, FV :FV = − f V v, so that the driving force is:F D = F + FV = F − f V v "
 (5
"100)Reasonable values for the parameters are F = 400 N, and f v = 25"
8 sN/m
 (Thesevalues are chosen to make the maximum velocity reasonable—they are not based ona physiological consideration)
"(h) If you assume that the runner is subject only to these two driving forces, what ishis maximum velocity? (You can ignore the drag term, D, in this calculation)"
"In addition, during the first few seconds the runner is crouched and acceleratingrapidly"
" In this phase, his cross-sectional area is smaller because he is crouched, andthe driving force exerted by the runner is larger than later"
 Let us also introduce theseaspects into our model
"First, let us assume that the crouched phase lasts approximately for a time, tc"
 Wedo not expect this phase to end abruptly at a specific time
" Instead, we expect thedriving force to decrease gradually (and the cross-sectional area to increase gradually)as the runner is going from a crouched to an upright running position"
" A commonway to approximate such a change is through an exponential function that dependson the time and the characteristic time, tc"
" For example, by introducing an initialdriving force, FC :FC = f c exp(−(t/t c)2) "
 (5
"101)When t = 0, the force is equal to f c, but as time increases, the force decreasesrapidly"
" When the time has reached t c, the force has dropped to 1/e  0"
"37 of thevalue at t = 0, and after a time 4t c this contribution to the driving force has droppedto less than 2 % of its initial value"
Notice that we do not have any experimental or theoretical reason to use thisparticular form for the time dependence
 We have simply chosen a convenient form5
"9 Newton’s Third Law 137as a first approximation, and then we use this form and try to get reasonable resultswith it"
" A better approach would be to have experimental data on how the force variedduring the first few seconds, but unfortunately we do not know this"
" Making roughestimates that you can subsequently improve by better measurements, calculations,or theory will be an important part of how you apply physics in practice"
The total driving force is then:F D = F + f c exp(−(t/t c)2) − f v v 
 (5
102)where reasonable values for the parameters are f c = 488 N and t c = 0
67 s
 (Thesevalues are chosen so that the total race-time becomes reasonable)
"In addition, we need to modify the air resistance force because the runner iscrouched in the initial phase, so that the cross-sectional area is reduced"
" We thereforeneed to replace the cross-sectional area A in the expression for D with a time-dependent expression, A(t), with the properties that: (1) when time is zero, thearea should be reduced to 75 % of the area during upright running (again, we guessreasonable values); and (2) after a time much larger than tc, the runner is upright,and the cross-sectional area should be A"
" Again, we introduce a modification to thearea that depends on the exponential factor used above:A(t) = A − 0"
25A exp(−(t/t c)2) = A(1 − 0
25 exp(−(t/t c)2))
 (5
103)The air resistance force therefore becomes:D = 12 A(t)ρC D (v − w)2 = 12 A(1 − 0
25e−(t/t c )2 )ρC D (v − w)2 (5
"104)The total force on the runner is:Fnet = F + FC − FV − D = F + f c e−(t/t c )2− f v v − D , (5"
"105)where F = 400 N is a constant driving force, and the other terms have been addressedabove"
(i) Modify your numerical method to include these new forces
" Find and plot x(t),v(t), and a(t) for the motion"
"(j) How fast does he run 100 m?(k) Compare the magnitudes of the various forces acting on the runner by plottingF (which is constant), FC , FV and D as a function of time for a 100 m race"
 Discusshow important the various effects are
(l) Use the model to test how the resulting time on 100 m would change if the runnerhad a hind wind with a wind speed of w = 1 m/s
 What if he was running into a windwith a wind speed of w = 1 m/s?5
30 Modelling Bungee Jumping Numerically
 In this exercise we will studya person bungee jumping
" The bungee cord acts as an ideal spring with a spring138 5 Forces in One Dimensionconstant k when it is stretched, but it has no strength when pushed together"
 Thecord’s equilibrium length is d
" There is also a form of dampening in the cord, whichwe will model as a force which is dependent on the speed of the cord’s deformation"
"When the cord is stretched a length x, and is being stretched with the instantaneousspeed v, the force from the spring is given asF(x, v) ={ −k(x − d) − cv v when x > d0 when x ≤ dwhere cv is a constant that describes the dampening in the cord, and k is the springconstant"
We set x = 0 to be where the bungee cord is attached and let the positive directionof the x-axis point downwards
 A person with a mass m places the cord around thewaist and jumps from the point where it is attached
 The initial velocity is v0 = 0
You can neglect air resistance and assume that the bungee cord is massless
 Themotion is solely vertical
 The acceleration of gravity is g
(a) Draw a free-body diagram of the person when the bungee cord is taut
 Name allthe forces
(b) At what height is the person hanging when the motion has stopped?(c) Write a numerical algorithm that finds the persons position and velocity at thetime t + Δt given the persons position and velocity at a time t
 And implement thisalgorithm in a program that finds the motion of a person bungee jumping

 Theacceleration of gravity is g = 9
8 m/s 2 
 What is a reasonable choice for cv? Explainyour choice
"(e) Is the system conservative during the whole motion, parts of the motion, or notat all? Explain"
(f) How would our model be different if we included air resistance?Chapter 6Motion in Two and Three DimensionsYou have now learned to use Newton’s second law
 This is the main tool you need tosolve problems in mechanics
" However, so far, we have only addressed motion andforces in one dimension"
" Fortunately, the description of motion and Newton’s laws donot change when we go to higher dimensions"
 We can continue to apply the structuredproblem-solving approach in exactly the same way as we did before
" But in order toaddress motion in two- and three dimensions, we need to extend our mathematicaland numerical methods to address two- and three-dimensional motion"
 This will bedone in two parts: In this chapter we introduce general two- and three-dimensionalmotion
" Later we will introduce constrained motion—motion constrained to occuralong a specific path in the same way a rollercoaster cart is constrained to follow therollercoaster track, or in the way a part of a rotating body is following the rotationof the body"

1 VectorsThe use of vectors to describe positions in two- and three-dimensional systems isessential in order to describe general motion
 If you are familiar with the use ofvectors you can safely jump to the next section
"Scalars and VectorsA scalar is a single number (with notation), such as a length, a mass, or a temperature"
"In order to describe physical quantities such as a displacement or a force, we need todescribe both a magnitude and a direction: A displacement is described by a distanceand a direction; A force is described by the magnitude of the force and the directionit acts in"

"1 a Illustration of vectors, b vector addition, c units vectors, decomposition and angle, ddot productA vector is a quantity with both direction and length"
 A vector can have physicalunits
We indicate that a quantity is a vector by drawing a small arrow above it: a
 1 It will beimportant for you to use a notation that clearly separates vector and scalar quantities
"Because one of the most common mistakes made by students is to mix up vectorsand scalars in their calculations, with dire results, we strongly urge you to use thearrow notation for vectors and to stick with it"
Vector AdditionVector addition is intuitive for the addition of displacements (see Fig
 6
"1b): If youfirst move along the vector a from A to B, and then along the vector b from B to C,the net displacement is the vector:c = a + b , (6"
1)from point A to C
"This geometric definition of vector addition is general, and we use it also for vec-tors that are not displacements: We find the sum of two vectors a and b geometricallyby placing the tail of vector b at the tip of vector a"
 The sum is called the resultantvector
1 Our definition of a vector is rather limited compared to the more general definition of vector spacesyou may be used to in mathematics
" It means we usually limit ourselves to vectors in one, two, andthree Cartesian dimensions"
" Usually, we illustrate a vector by an arrow, as shown in Fig"
 6
1a
" Thelength of the arrow indicates the magnitude, and the direction shows the direction of the vector"
Notice that it does not matter where we start drawing a vector
 The vector a in Fig
 6
"1 is the sameeven if it is drawn in position A, B, or C, but the vector b in position D is different, because it hasa different direction than a, and the vector c in position E is different from both a and b since ithas a different magnitude"
 Remember: The only thing that matters for a vector is its magnitude anddirection—not where it starts
6
"1 Vectors 141From this definition, we realize that vector addition is commutative, the order ofaddition is arbitrary, and associative:a + b = b + a , (commutative law) (6"
"2)a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c , (associative law) (6"
3)Scalar MultiplicationWe can rescale the length of a vector by multiplying it with a scalar:b = 2a 
 (6
"4)Vector b is twice as long as vector a, but still pointing in the same direction"
" Bymultiplying a vector with a scalar we change the magnitude, but not the direction ofthe vector"
"If we multiply a vector by 0, we get a vector of zero length, called the zero vector:0a = 0 "
 (6
"5)If we multiply a vector by a negative number, we change the direction of the vectorto point in the opposite direction"
" For example, if we multiply with a vector with−1, we get the negative vector—a vector of the same length, but which points in theopposite direction"
Vector ComponentsA coordinate system is a grid you choose to describe the world in numbers
 You arefree to choose any coordinate system you like: You may choose where to place theorigin and how to orient the axis
" When you have decided on this, we use the coordi-nate system to describe a vector by decomposing the vector in the given coordinatesystem"
"Here, we use Cartesian coordinate systems, where the axes are orthogonal to eachother"
" We describe the coordinate system by the position of the origin, O, and byunit vectors pointing along each axis: the x-, y-, and z-axis"
" The unit vectors are ofunit length, of length 1, and do not have any unit"
" The unit vectors are orthogonal,they form 90◦ angles with each other, as illustrated in Fig"
 6
1c
" It is common to usethe symbol i, j, and k for the unit vectors along the x, y, and z-axis respectively"
"142 6 Motion in Two and Three DimensionsAny vector can be uniquely decomposed into a set of component vectors alongeach of the axes:A = Ax + Ay , (6"
6)as illustrated in Fig
 6
"1c, where each of the component vectors can be written interms of the unit vector along the axis:Ax = A x i , Ay = A y j "
 (6
"7)Here, the units of the vectors are in the scalar numbers A x and A y "
"If you know the magnitude and direction of a vector, you can find the componentof the vector from trigonometrical considerations"
" For example, the vector A shownin Fig"
 6
"1c, may be decomposed into its x- and y-components by:A = A x i + A y j = |A| cos φ i + |A| sin φ j "
 (6
"8)We may write a vector by using the unit vectors or by writing the vector directly incoordinate form:A = A x i + A y j + A z k = (A x , A y , A z) "
 (6
"9)The Magnitude of a Vector Using ComponentsIf the coordinate system is orthogonal, then all the axis are orthogonal to each other,and we can use Pythagoras’ theorem to relate the magnitude to the vector to thecomponents:|A| =√A2x + A2y + A2z "

"The dot product is linear:(A + B) · C = A · C + B · C , (6"
14)and commutative:A · B = B · A 
 (6
"15)The dot product depends on the angle α, as illustrated in Fig"
 6
1d
" When two vectorsare parallel and point in the same direction, the dot product is equal to the product ofthe magnitudes"
 A particular useful property of the dot product is that the dot productof two orthogonal vectors is zero
 As a result the dot product is simple on componentformA · B = (A x i + A y j) · (B x i + B y j)= A x B x i · i︸︷︷︸=1+A x B y i · j︸︷︷︸=0+A y B x j · i︸︷︷︸=0+A y B y j · j︸︷︷︸=1= A x B x + A y B y 
(6
16)The value of the dot product is independent of the unit vectors used to decomposethe vectors
 We say that the dot product is invariant under a change of coordinatesystem
"What makes the dot product so useful, is that it can be used to decompose a vectoronto a given set of unit vector—it can be used to find the components of a vector inany given coordinate system"
 A vector A can be written in component form as:A = A x i + A y j + A z k 
 (6
"17)How can we determine the components A x , A y , and A z ? We find them by using to dotproduct, and remembering that the unit vectors are orthogonal"
" We find componentA x from:A · i = A x i · i︸︷︷︸=1+A y j · i︸︷︷︸=0+A z k · i︸︷︷︸=0= A x , (6"
"18)and similarly for the other components:144 6 Motion in Two and Three DimensionsThe component of a vector A can be found by dot-multiplication with the unitvectors i, j, and k:A x = A · i , A y = A · j , A z = A · k , (6"
19)so thatA = (A · i) i + (A · j) j + (A · k) k 
 (6
20)Numerical Representation of VectorsIn Python a vector is represented by its component form
" The vector a:a = 1 i + 2 j = (1, 2, 0) , (6"
"21)is generated by the following command:a = array([1,2,0]);Addition and SubtractionAll the ordinary mathematical operations can be applied to vectors just as you wouldapply them to scalars"
" For example, vector addition is achieved by:b = array([2,-4,0])c = a + bprint(c)[ 3 -2 0]You can decide if you want to use a vector in two- or three dimensions"
" For example,you could instead have defined the vector a as:a = array([1,2]);But notice that you cannot add two vectors that do not have the same number ofcomponents"
Scalar MultiplicationScalar multiplication is similarly naturally implemented:d = 3*aprint(d)[3 6 0]6
1 Vectors 145Componentwise OperationsNotice that there is room for error because of the way commands are interpreted
"For example, if you add a scalar to a vector, this is interpreted as a componentwiseaddition: The scalar is added to each of the components:e = a + 3print(e)[4 5 3]Dot ProductThe dot product is found by applying the function dot, which returns a scalar:f = dot(a,b)print(f)-6A common application of the dot product is to find the component of a vector a alongthe direction given by a vector b"
" In general, b, is not a unit vector"
" We therefore firstneed to find a unit vector in the direction of b:ub = b|b| , (6"
22)and the component of a in this direction is given by the dot product:a b = a · ub = a · b|b| 
 (6
"23)Numerically, this is done in exactly the same way:ab = dot(a,b)/sqrt(dot(b,b));print(ab)Notice that we use the relation:|b| = √b · b , (6"
24)for the magnitude of b
"Time Sequences of VectorsWe will often work with a sequence of vectors, corresponding to the time evolutionof a vector"
" For example, we may be interested in the position, r, or the force, F, asa function of time, t:146 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensionsr(t) and F(t) "
 (6
"25)Numerically, we will have a corresponding sequence of positions or forces at discretetimes, ti :ri = r(ti ) and Fi = F(ti ) "
 (6
"26)Fortunately, it is simple to both represent and apply mathematical operations to anelement in a sequence"
"We generate a sequence of n vectors ri with x, y, and z coordinates by:n = 10r = zeros((n,3),float)We can use mathematical vector operations directly on element in the sequence, asillustrated in the following example:v = array([1"
"0,-2"
"0,2"
"0])n = 10r = zeros((n,3),float)r[0] = array([0,0,0]);dt = 0"

2 Description of MotionThe cheetah is the world fastest land animal
 How can we characterize its motion asit chases its prey? How fast does it run and how fast does it turn?Motion Diagram and Position VectorFigure 6
2 shows a few frames from a movie of a cheetah chasing a Thompson gazelle
To quantify the motion we generate a motion diagram: We mark the position of thecheetah at regular time intervals and record the positions r(ti ) of the cheetah relativeto the origin at time ti 
We are free to choose the origin and the axes of the coordinate system
 Theorigin determines where we measure the positions from
 In Fig
 6
2 we have chosena stationary point on the ground as the origin
" In addition to the origin, a coordinatesystem consists of a set of axes that we use to decompose the position vector"
 Thedirections of the axes indicate the positive direction of the corresponding unit vector
"The position can be decomposed along the x, y, and z-axes respectively (Table 6"
"1):r(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j + z(t) k , (6"
"27)where x(t), y(t), and z(t) are lengths along the axes and hence have units of length"
"For example, the position at t = 0"

0 s)
" Because the displacement depends on a differencebetween two positions, it does not depend on the choice of origin"
We see from Fig
 6
2 that both the length and the direction of the displacementvectors are changing throughout the motion
" The rate of change of the displacement,the velocity, must therefore also be a vector:The average velocity from a time t = t0 to a time t = t0 + Δt is defined as:¯v(t0) = r(t0 + Δt) − r(t0)Δt = Δr(t0)Δt "

 (6
"34)Whenever we use the term velocity, we will mean the instantaneous velocity"
The velocity vector is tangential to the trajectory
"SpeedThe magnitude of the velocity vector is called the speed, v, defined as:v(t) = |v(t)| "
 (6
"35)We use the word velocity for the velocity vector, and the word speed for the magnitudeof the vector velocity"
"Time Derivatives of Vector FunctionsHow do we find the derivative of a vector function such as r(t)? The simplest approachis to write the vector in terms of the unit vectors for the coordinate system, and thentake the derivative of each component:v(t) = ddt r(t) = ddt (x(t) i + y(t) j + z(t) k) = dxdt i + dydt j + dzdt k , (6"
"36)150 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensionswhere3 we define the component-wise velocities asv x (t) = dxdt , v y (t) = dydt , v z (t) = dzdt "
 (6
"37)The velocity vector can therefore also be written:v(t) = v x (t) i + v y (t) j + v z (t) k = (v x (t), v y (t), v z (t)) "
 (6
38)AccelerationIt is clear from Fig
 6
2 that the average velocity of the cheetah is not constant through-out the motion—it is varying both in direction and magnitude
" Just as we introducedvelocity to characterize the change in the position vector, we introduce the acceler-ation vector to characterize the change in the velocity vector:The average acceleration vector over a time interval Δt from t to t + Δt isdefined as:¯a = v(t + Δt) − v(t)Δt "
 (6
"39)We define the instantaneous acceleration vector, or simply the instantaneousacceleration, as the limit of the average acceleration vector when the timeinterval approaches zero:a(t) = limΔt→0v(t + Δt) − v(t)Δt = dvdt = ˙v "
 (6
40)The acceleration vector is the time derivative of the velocity vector
"We find the acceleration in the vector component representation by componentwisederivation:a(t) = ddt v = ddt(v x i + v y j + v z k)= dv xdt i + dv ydt j + dv zdt k = a x (t) i + a y (t) j + a z (t) k , (6"
"41)where we see that:a x (t) = dv xdt , a y (t) = dv ydt , a z (t) = dv zdt "
 (6
42)3 Here we have implicitly assumed that the time derivatives of the unit vectors are zero
 This is notnecessarily the case: The unit vectors vary with time for rotating reference systems
6
"2 Description of Motion 151Since the velocity vector is the time derivative of the position vectorv(t) = ddt r(t) , (6"
"43)we can write the acceleration vector as the second time derivative of the positionvector:a(t) = ddt v = ddtddt r = d2rdt2 , (6"
"44)which can be written on component form:a x (t) = dv xdt = d2 xdt2 , a y (t) = dv ydt = d2 ydt2 , a z (t) = dv zdt = d2zdt2 "
 (6
"45)Notation for Time DerivativesIn physics, we use both the differential form, d/dt and the dot notation for timederivatives:v = drdt = ˙r , (6"
"46)anda = dvdt = ˙v = ¨r , (6"
"47)but we do not use the “marked” notation, v x = x′(t), often used in mathematicsbecause we often use x′(t) to mean the position x measured in another coordinatesystem"
" We therefore strongly recommend you to use the notations introduced here,either the d/dt notation or the dot-notation"
"Interpretation of Motion DiagramsIt is often takes time to gain a good intuition for acceleration, in particular for two- andthree-dimensional motions"
 Motion diagrams can help in developing that intuitionby visualizing velocities and accelerations
"If the motion diagram is drawn using a constant time interval Δt, we can use thedisplacement vector as a visualization of the velocity, since the velocity is propor-tional to the displacement:152 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100010203040x [ m]y [ m]Fig"

Notice that if we want to look at the change in velocity at the time t = 1
"0 s,we would like to compare the velocity before the time t = 1"

0 s
" Now, the average velocity at the time t = 1"
0 s is really theaverage velocity over the time interval from 1
0 to 1
5 s
 And the average velocityat the time t = 0
5 s is the average velocity over the time interval from 0

"Therefore, a reasonable way to characterize the change in velocity at t = 1"
0 s is tocharacterize it as the change in velocity over the time interval from 0

"d,4 which has been reduced to bestrictly two-dimensional"
 Each line in the data set contains the following information:t1 x1 y1 z1t2 x2 y2 z2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"The time is given in days, and the spatial coordinates are measured in kilometers"
"We read the data set into Python to examine the motion, using loadtxt:from pylab import *t,x,y=loadtxt(’marsexpresslr"
"d’,usecols=[0,1,2],unpack=True)n = len(t)dt = t[1] - t[0]r = zeros((n,2),float)r[:,0] = xr[:,1] = yThis generates the arrays t, x, and y, which we combine to one array to form r"
"This provides us with a vector r(ti ), which contains the x- and y-componentsr(ti ) = x(ti ) i + y(ti ) j "
 (6
53)The vector representation in Python is useful and allows us to make operations on thewhole vector in a very similar way to how we write the operations mathematically
We demonstrate this by converting the lengths to astronomical units
" The x- and y-coordinates in the data-set are measured in kilometers, but we would like to measurelengths in Astronomical Units, where 1AU = 149,598,000 km"
 An astronomical unit(1 AU) roughly corresponds to the average radius of the orbit of the Earth around theSun—it is therefore a useful unit for describing planetary motion
 We can convertthe data by dividing the length by 1 AU
" Mathematically, we would write this as:r′(t) = 11 AU r(t) "
 (6
"54)Using the vector representation, the implementation in Python is almost identical:AU = 149598000"
0r = r/AUHow does this work? The command r/a divides each element in the array by a =1 AU—both the x and the y coordinate for all times i
" This is a very intuitive andefficient way of coding, and you should learn to utilize the power of vectorization"

" Noticethat r[:,0] gives the x i for all i, and similarly for the yi "
The resulting trajectory is shown by a dotted line in Fig

" Unfortunately, thisdata-set only contains the position of the module every 30 days"
" This only gives us acoarse illustration of the motion, but we are still able to see the main features"
Motion diagram: The plot of the trajectory itself does not provide much insight intothe motion of the module
 We can gain more insight through a motion diagram or bycalculating the velocity and acceleration of the module along the trajectory
" Sincethe data is so coarse, we start by illustrating the velocities and the accelerations inthe diagrams"
The average velocity is proportional to the displacement:¯vi = 1Δt Δri = 1Δt (r(ti+1) − r(ti )) 
 (6
55)We can therefore illustrate the velocities by drawing the displacement vectors fromri to ri+1 
" This is done by drawing an arrow from r[i,:] to r[i+1,:] usingthe quiver command, which draws an arrow from a point ri and in a distanceΔri = ri+1 −ri "
 Notice the additional arguments provided to the quiver commandto ensure that the arrows have correct length and orientation
 Also remember to replotthe previous figure and to add show() at the end of the script
"for i in range(n-1):plot(r[i,0],r[i,1],’o’)dr = r[i+1,:] - r[i,:]quiver(r[i,0],r[i,1],dr[0],dr[1],angles=’xy’,scale_units=’xy’,scale=1)show()The loop stops at n−1, since we cannot find the displacement from i = n to i = n+1"
The arrow illustrating the (average) velocities are shown in Fig

"Similarly, the acceleration is approximately given by the change in velocities:a  1Δt (v(ti ) − v(ti−1)) , (6"
56)We use the velocities in ti and ti−1 because the velocity in ti is calculated from thepoints ti and ti+1 and the velocity in ti−1 is calculated from the points ti−1 and ti 
" Inthis way, the acceleration is properly centered"
 This becomes clear by reviewing themotion diagram in Fig

" To find the acceleration in point 1, we need to use thevelocities (displacements) from point 0 and 1"

" Forsimplicity, we assume that both the Earth and Mars follow circular orbits with radiR E = 1 au and R M = 1"
"5 au, and periods (the time a complete revolution takes) ofT E = 1 year = 365"

" The trajectory for acircular orbit with radius R and period T can be described byr(t) = R (i cos ωt + j sin ωt) , (6"

 Therefore wehave not taken care to ensure that the initial positions at t = 0 for Mars or the Earthare correct relative to each other
" (That is, we do not care where the planets are att = 0)"

"61)The magnitude of the velocity is therefore a constant:|v| = Rω |−i sin ωt + j cos ωt| = Rω = 2π R/T , (6"
62)which corresponds to the distance traveled during one complete revolution dividedby the time it takes to make a revolution
 We therefore now have numbers we can useto compare with the results from our calculations

"3 Calculation of MotionWe are typically not given a description of the motion, instead we have measuredthe velocity or the acceleration or we have a theory for the acceleration, and we wantto determine the motion"
 This requires us to integrate the equations of motion
" Thuswe need methods to determine the motion of an object in two and three dimensionsgiven a set of measurements of the velocity or the acceleration, given a mathematicalexpression for the velocity or the acceleration, or given a differential equation forthe velocity or acceleration"

" After the flight, you recover the probe and read outthe accelerations"

" We want to use this sequence of accelerations,a(ti ) to find both the sequence of velocities, v(ti ), and the sequence of positions, r(ti )of the probe"
" Just as for one-dimensional motion, we use the expression for the numer-ical derivative of the velocity, the average acceleration, to determine the velocities"
The average acceleration vector from the time ti to ti+1 = ti + Δt is:¯a(ti ) = v(ti + Δt) − v(ti )Δt

69)We solve for v(ti + Δt) to step forward in time:v(ti + Δt) − v(ti ) = Δt · ¯a(ti ) (6
70)v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + Δt · ¯a(ti ) 
"Even though the accelerometer does not provide the average acceleration duringa time interval, but rather the instantaneous acceleration at the time, t0 , we get a162 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensionsreasonable approximation by assuming that the average acceleration is equal to theinstantaneous acceleration:¯a(t0)  a(ti ) "
 (6
"71)Indeed, this corresponds to the approximation used in the first order numerical deriv-ative"
"This produces a sequence of velocities, v(ti )"
" We can now use exactly the sameprocedure to find the positions from the velocities, since the velocity is the timederivative of the position"
" The velocity from time ti to ti+1 = ti +Δt is approximatelygives as the average velocity:v(ti )  r(ti + Δt) − r(ti )Δt , (6"

"Formal IntegrationIf we know a mathematical expression for the acceleration vector, we can find thevelocity and position vector by integration"
 We start from the acceleration and inte-grate from t0 to t to find the velocity:dvdt = a(t) ⇒∫ tt0dvdt dt = v(t) − v(t0) =∫ tt0a(t) dt 
 (6
79)This allows you to find the velocity from the acceleration
" If the acceleration is oncomponent form, you integrate each component to find the velocity:∫ tt0 a(t) dt = ∫ tt0(a x (t) i + a y (t) j + a z (t) k) dt=(∫ tt0 a x (t) dt)i +(∫ tt0 a y (t) dt)j +(∫ tt0 a z (t) dt)k "
 (6

 (6
81)We insert the result for v(t) from (6

"11 Illustration of the structured problem-solving approachSo far, we have addressed the case when you have measured the acceleration vec-tor, a(t), either for only a discrete number of time steps, or you can have a theoreticalprediction for the acceleration for all times"
" However, usually, we do not know howthe acceleration of an object varies in time, but we rather have models for how theacceleration depends on the position of the object, or the velocity of the object"
" Fora probe scrambling through a tornado, it is the position and velocity of the proberelative to the tornado that determine the forces acting on it and therefore its accel-eration"
" In this case, we cannot integrate the acceleration, because the accelerationalso depends on velocity and position"
"Generally, modeling the forces and applying Newton’s second law leads to anexpression:d2rdt2 = a(r, v, t) = a(r, drdt , t)(6"
"86)For example, a viscous force model leads to an acceleration:d2rdt2 = a = −cv = −c drdt , (6"
87)and a spring force model leads to an acceleration on the form:d2rdt2 = a = −Cr rr 
 (6
"88)We see that the unknown function, r(t), occurs on both sides of the equality—therefore we cannot simply integrate over time to find the solution"
 These are exam-ples of differential equations
" In some cases they can be solved using analytical tech-niques, but in most cases we will need to turn to numerical methods"
" Fortunately, inmany cases the numerical solution of these differential equations can be done usingmethods identical to the methods we have developed for direct integration"
6
"3 Calculation of Motion 167One of the major steps in the structured problem-solving approach is the “Solver”,where you find the time evolution of the velocity and position vectors from an equa-tion for the acceleration and the initial conditions:d2rdt2 = a(r, drdt , t), v(t0) = v0 , r(t0) = r0 "
 (6
"89)The result of the “Solver” step is the velocity and position as a function of time, eitheras continuous, mathematical functions, v(t), and r(t), or as the numerical solutionsof the equations calculated at discrete time steps, v(ti ) and r(ti )"
" However, unless thetime resolution, ti , is determined by the time intervals of an experimental data-set,your numerical solution can be found at any time resolution you like"
Numerical SolutionWe have seen several examples of how to find the numerical solution when theacceleration or velocity vectors are given functions of time
 Let us now illustrate ageneral approach that also works for a differential equation of the form in (6
89)
 Weknow the initial position and velocity at t = t0 
 The acceleration at t = t0 is thereforegiven by (6
89)
 Let us to find the velocity and position at t = t1 after a small timeinterval Δt at t1 = t0 + Δt
" We use Euler-Cromer’s method to find the new velocityvector based on the acceleration vector at t = t0 , and then to find the new positionbased on the position at t = t0 and the velocity at t = t1 :v(t0 + Δt)  v(t0) + Δt a(t0, r(t0), v(t0)) (6"

 (6
"91)We can continue this method iteratively, finding in sequence first t1 , then t2 and soon, until we have reached the time t"
"In Euler-Cromer’s method we solve the (second order) initial value problem:d2rdt2 = a(r, drdt , t), v(t0) = v0 , r(t0) = r0 "
 (6
"92)using the following iterative procedure:v(ti + Δt)  v(ti ) + Δt a(ti , r(ti ), v(ti ))r(ti + Δt)  r(ti ) + Δt v(ti + Δt) (6"
93)168 6 Motion in Two and Three DimensionsYou should in general think of the “Solver” as a call to a numerical function thatreturns the position and velocity vectors given the functional form of the accelerationand the initial conditions
" When you grow up to become a professional physicist,you will have built your own set of methods and tools, numerical and analytical, to“Solve” problems"
" In particular, we advice you to use a fourth order Runge-Kuttamethod as your preferred method of numerical integration, although in this bookwe will focus on clarity and simplicity instead, and typically use Euler-Cromer’smethod, unless this produces significant errors"

"1 Example: Feather in the WindIn this example you learn to find the position and velocity from the acceleration,when the acceleration is given by a simplified mathematical model, and when it isgiven by a differential equation"
You are planning to reproduce the introductory film in Forrest Gump—by cap-turing the motion of a feather caught in the wind
" You plan to start with a featherdropped from a lift, at a height h above the ground"
 A slight wind is blowing
" Ourtask is to find the motion of the feather, given its acceleration"
"Sketch: As always, a good sketch solves half the problem"
 For simplicity we assumethat the motion is two-dimensional
 Figure 6
"12 shows a sketch of the path of thefeather, including the velocity of the wind"
"Simplified model—Free fall: The simplest, and least realistic, model for the fallingfeather is to assume that it falls without air resistance"
" We release the feather witha horizontal velocity equal to that of the wind, v0 = w, and then assume that it hasconstant acceleration, a = −gj"
 We can then find the motion by integration
a = −g j (6

 Wefind the velocity by direct integration:v(t) = v(t0) +∫ tt0a dt = w +∫ t0−g j dt = w − gt j 
 (6
"95)We can simplify this a bit further if the wind is horizontal, w = w i:v(t) = w i − gt j "
 (6
96)We find the position by integrating once more over time:r(t) = r(t0) + ∫ tt0 v(t) dt = r0 + ∫ t0 (w i − gt j) dt= h j + wt i − 12 gt2 j 
 (6
"97)This gives us a complete solution for this simplified model, which is useful as acomparison when we address the full model"
"Realistic model: A more realistic model includes two additional effects: Air resis-tance means that the acceleration depends on the velocity of the feather and thevelocity of the wind, and the wind typically varies near the ground"
" A better modelfor the acceleration of the feather is:a = −g j − C|v − w| (v − w) , (6"
98)where w is the velocity of the wind
" A realistic model for the wind isw(r) = w0(1 − e−y/b), (6"
"99)In this case, b = 5 m and w0 = 3 m/s i is the velocity of the wind"
" We drop thefeather from rest from a position r0 = h j, with h = 10 m"
"Unfortunately, we cannot solve this equation exactly, but it is not difficult to solvenumerically"
 We apply Euler-Cromer’s method
" We find the velocity and position attime ti + Δt from the position and velocity at ti using:v(ti + Δt)  v(ti ) + Δt a(ti , vi ) (6"

0 m−1 for the feather
"Notice that the acceleration depends not only on the velocity v(t) of the feather,but also on its position, because the velocity of the air, w, depends on the positionof the feather"
" We therefore first calculate w(r) and then calculate a(t, r, v)"
 This isimplemented in the following program

" The coordinate system S is fixed to theground, and the coordinate system S′ follows the car6"
4 Frames of ReferenceConsider a person driving in an open convertible at constant velocity
 She throws aball straight up into the air
" According to her, the ball moves straight up along they-axis and falls straight down along the y-axis into her arms"
 A simple feat
" However,a spectator standing by the road tells a different story"
" He observed the person in thecar throwing the ball with an initial horizontal as well as vertical velocity componentin a curved, parabolic path, and then she caught the ball exactly as it fell back to itsoriginal height"
 A more impressive feat as seen from the sidewalk
 The two storiesare illustrated in Fig
 6
14
 In this section we address how we can relate these twoobservations
"The motion of the ball can be described in a reference system S, on the sidewalk,and in a reference system S′ which moves with the car"
 The position of the ball asmeasured in system S at a time t (measured in S) is r(t)
" Similar, the position of theball as measured in the system S′ at a time t′ (measured in S′) is r′(t′)"
 The positionof the system S′ measured in system S is R
 We can therefore relate the positions inthe two systems by:r = R + r′ 
 (6
102)Let us assume that the time is the same in all reference systems
" That is, we assumethere is a universal time so that the time measured in system S is the same as thetime measured in system S′"
" As we will learn later, this is only approximately trueas long as the reference systems are not moving very fast relative to each other"
What is the velocity of the object measured in system S?v = drdt = ddt(R + r′) = dRdt + dr′dt 
 (6
103)System S′ is moving with a velocity u = dR/dt relative to system S—this is thevelocity of the car (system S′) in Fig
 6
14 relative to the sidewalk (system S)
" Since172 6 Motion in Two and Three Dimensionswe have assumed that the time is universal, we have that:dr′(t′)dt′ = v′ = r′(t)dt , (6"
104)which is the vector velocity of the object measured in system S′
 This correspondsto the vector velocity of the ball measured from the car in Fig
 6
14
The relation between the velocities is thereforev = u + v′ 
 (6
"105)If system S′ moves at a constant velocity relative to system S, du/dt = 0, and theaccelerations of the object are the same inboth systems:a = a′ "
 (6
106)This transformation is called the Gallileo-transformation
 The acceleration of anobject is the same in all systems moving at constant velocities relative to each other
This means that the acceleration is an invariant in the Gallileo-transformations
 Wecall all systems moving at constant velocities inertial systems
" Because Newton’slaws determine the accelerations, Newton’s laws are only valid in inertial systems"
"If we now return to the case of the car, we can explain the behavior"
 The accel-eration of the ball is the same in a system on the ground and in all systems movingat constant velocity relative to the ground
" The car is such a system, moving with aconstant velocity u relative to the ground"
 The acceleration of the ball is thereforethe same in the sidewalk-system S and in the car’s system S′
" However, the initialvelocities are different in the two systems"
" In system S′ the ball is thrown straight up,which means that the initial velocity only has a component along the y′-axis of the S′system: v′0 = v0 j"
" In system S, the initial velocity has both a vertical and horizontalcomponent, because the relation between the two velocities are given by (6"
"105):v = u + v′ = u i + v0 j , (6"
107)where u is the speed of the car in the horizontal direction
" Seen from the car, it isobvious that the ball falls down into the car, since it was thrown with no horizontalvelocity component relative to the car"

" It is important to draw all the coordinate systems we will be using:We use a coordinate system S with axes x and y, which is on the riverbank, and asystem S′, with axes x′ and y′ which is following the motion of the river"
" The riveris flowing in the x-direction, and the x and x′ directions are parallel"
"Position of the boat: The position of the boat in system S, which is stationary onthe riverbank, is r(t)"
" The position of the boat in the system S′, which is followingthe water in the river, is r′(t) and the two positions are related by:r(t) = R(t) + r′(t) , (6"
108)where R(t) is the position of system S′ measured relative to system S
"Velocity of the boat: If we know the velocity of the boat relative to the water, v′b,then we find the velocity of the boat relative to the bank by taking the time derivativeof (6"

 (6
109)Driving straight across the river: We can use this result to find what velocity theboat must have in order to drive straight across the river
" To drive straight acrossthe river means that the boat should have no velocity along the riverbank, that is,vb,x = 0"
" Since we know that u is directed along the x-axis, u = u i, the velocity ofthe boat is:vb = u i + v′b , (6"

"Driving with constant velocity: If the boat is driving with a constant velocity v′b,what is the position of the boat after a time t? We can find the position in eithersystem S or in system S′—the result will be the same"
 If we find the position insystem S′ we need to transform the velocity first
" The velocity of the boat in systemS is:vb = u + v′b , (6"
113)and the position is therefore:rb(t) = r(t0) + ∫ tt0 vb(t) dt = r(t0) + ∫ tt0(u + v′b) dt= r(t0) + (u + v′b) (t − t0) 
 (6
"114)Driving with varying velocity: The velocity of the boat relative to the river, v′b(t),is recorded by the speedometer"
 We can therefore use (6

"SummaryMotion:• The motion of an object is described by the position vector, r(t), as a function oftime, measured in a specified coordinate system"
• The velocity vector of the object is defined asv(t) = drdt 
• The acceleration vector of the object is defined asa(t) = dvdt = d2rdt2 
176 6 Motion in Two and Three DimensionsProblem-solving approach:• We solve problems in kinematics using a structured approach
"• In the “Solver” we solve the equation:d2rdt2 = a(t, r, drdt)"
with the initial conditions r(t0) = r0 and v(t0) = v0 
• Numerically: We solve the equation using an iterative approach starting from theinitial conditions
" For example, we can use Euler-Cromer’s method:v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + Δt a(r(ti ), v(ti ), ti )r(ti + Δt) = r(ti ) + Δt v(ti + Δt) "
"• Analytically: When the acceleration, a = a(t), is only a function of time, t, wecan solve the equations by direct integration:v(t) = v(t0) +∫ tt0a(t) dt ,r(t) = r(t0) +∫ tt0v(t) dt "
A typical example is motion with constant acceleration
• The derivative of a vector function such as r(t) is found by componentwise deriva-tion
" Ifr(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j + z(t) k ,the derivative is:drdt = dxdt i + dydt j + dzdt k "
• The integral of a vector function is found by componentwise integration
" Forv(t) = v x (t) i + v y (t) j + v z (t) k ,the integral is∫ tt0v(t)dt =(∫ tt0v x (t)dt)i +(∫ tt0v y (t)dt)j +(∫ tt0v z (t)dt)k "

"Chapter 7Forces in Two and Three DimensionsWe have now introduced a vectorized description of motion that allows us to discussmotion not only in one dimension, but also for two- and three-dimensional systems"
"However, in order to predict and calculate the motion, we need to extend Newton’slaws to two and three dimensions, and we need to introduce force models that areapplicable in two and three dimensions"
 This is the focus of the current chapter
"The structured problem-solving approach used to address problems in mechanicshas exactly the same form for one-, two-, and three-dimensional problems (SeeFig"
 7
1 for an illustration)
" The first step is to identify what objects we are studying,how we characterize their position, and what reference system we use to describe themotion"
" Second, we model the system by finding the forces acting on the object, weintroduce models for the force, and use Newton’s second law to find the accelerationof the object"
" Third, we solve the equations of motion, and determine the positionand velocity of the objects as functions of time"
" Finally, we analyze the resultingmotion, use the solution to answer the questions posed, and check the validity of thesolutions"
"In this chapter, we discuss how to identify forces, how to apply Newton’s lawsin two- and three-dimensions, and we generalize all force models to two- and three-dimensional motion"

" We follow the enumerated steps from the general method,while commenting on how it is applied"
1
 Divide the problem into system and environment
"First, we define precisely what object we are studying the motion of—we discernbetween the system and the environment"
 We find the forces acting on the system
Everything that is not the system is the environment
"In this case the system is the car, and the environment is everything else, such as:the ground, the Earth, and the air around the car"
7
1 Identifying Forces 185The external forces may occur either at the contact between the car and the envi-ronment
 We call such forces contact forces
 Or they may be long-range forces
"Typically, we find the contact forces first and leave the long-range forces to last"
We find the contact forces by addressing the physical processes occurring along theexternal surface of the object:2
 Draw a figure of the object and everything in contact with the object
3
 Draw a closed curve around the system
4
 Find contact points—these are the points where contact forces may act
5
 Give names and symbols to all the contact forces
The car is in contact with the ground at the points where the four wheels aretouching the ground
 We have already discussed the possible ambiguity of a contactpoint
" In many cases the contact is not in a point, but distributed over an area"
" However,on a large scale, we can usually still represent the force as acting in a point"
What forces are acting in these points? Your answer to this question will dependon your insight into and knowledge about force models—what kinds of macroscopicforces are acting between objects
"Contact forces: Previously, we argued that we should separate the identificationof forces from the modeling of forces"
" Unfortunately, this is not really possible"
" Inpractice, we cannot separate the two steps"
" As we identify forces acting on a body,we are actually also identifying the interactions mechanisms, and we are alreadymaking assumptions on how to model the interactions"
"To make this rather abstract point more concrete, let us look at the example of thecar in detail"
" What forces are acting on the contact points between the car and theground?As a first approximation, we could introduce a single force vector, the contactforce C, acting in the point of contact and having a component both normal tothe ground and along the ground as illustrated in Fig"
 7
2b
" While this is a correctdescription—there is a force acting on the car from the ground, and it may havecomponents both normal and parallel to the ground—it is not a very useful way toidentify the forces"
 Why? Because we will not have a force model for this generalcontact force
" We could therefore introduce this general contact force here, but wewould need to decompose it into different physical models when we addressed howto model this force"
"Decomposing the contact force: Instead, what we mean when we say that weidentify the forces acting on the car in the contact point, is that we identify the differentforce models, and that we introduce an individual force for each of the models"
 Forthe contact between the ground and the car we could identify two different forcemodels: We recognize one force as due to the deformation of the wheel and theground
" This is the normal force, N from the ground on the car as illustrated inFig"
 7
2c
 We recognize another force as due to the sticking or sliding of the wheelrelative to the ground
" This is the friction force from the ground on the car, f"
" Noticethat when we identify forces, we are really identifying mechanisms or processes thatresult in a force, which is the first step in identifying a model to describe the force"
"186 7 Forces in Two and Three DimensionsOne or many contact forces: The contact forces from the ground on the car aretherefore the normal force, N, and the friction force, f"
 One force acts on each of thefour contact points of the car
" We may represent each of these forces individually, orwe could instead describe the whole car as one block with only a single contact pointwith the ground, and then represent the four contact forces only by a single force"
"In this case we should redraw our figure so that there is only one contact point, asshown in Fig"
 7
"2d, and only one normal force, N, and one friction force, f"
" Later on,when we study the equilibrium of an object, we will see that we need to use morethan one contact point to determine if the car is rotating or not"
"Choosing the direction of the vectors: We draw the normal force as a vector Npointing upwards, since we expect this to be the direction of the force"
" If the y-axis isthe direction normal to the hill, as illustrated in Fig"
 7
"2d, the normal force is N = N j"
"This simply means that if the normal force actually points in this direction, then N ispositive"
" Does it matter if we draw the vector in the “wrong direction”? What wouldhappen if we instead drew the normal force pointing downwards? In this case, wewould have N = N (−j), and a positive value of N would mean that the normalforce was acting downwards"
" We are therefore free to draw the vector in whateverdirection we want, the resulting numerical values for the components of the vectorwill tell us in what direction the force is acting at a particular time"
" However, youhave to be consistent: When you have drawn the vector in a particular direction, youneed to stick to your choice"
"Similarly, we draw a vector f pointing up along the hill to represent the frictionforce"
" With the x-axis pointing up along the hill, this means that: f = f i"
 The frictionforce may still act in the opposite direction for f < 0

 Draw in the axes of the coordinate system
 It is often convenient to make one axisparallel to the direction of motion
 When you choose direction of the axis youalso choose the positive direction for the axis
"When you are more experienced, you will probably follow the expert’s methodto find the free-body diagram, but you should not progress to this stage before you7"
1 Identifying Forces 187have practiced the first method on several examples and found that it is too simpleand elaborate for your taste
"Expert’s method for drawing a free-body diagram: Follow these steps tofind, identify, and draw all the forces acting on an object in a free-body dia-gram"

" Identify the system, and make a drawing of the system"
 You may sketch theenvironment in different colors or with a dotted line to help you

 Contact forces are acting at the contact points between the system andthe environment
" Identify, name, and draw each contact force as a vectorstarting at the point of contact"

 Choose a coordinate system and draw the axes of the coordinate systemin the same figure as the system
 It is often convenient to make one axisparallel to the direction of motion

"2 Newton’s Second LawWe have already introduced Newton’s laws of motion on a vector form, therefore,we do not need a new formulation for two- and three-dimensional problems"
"Newton’s second law relates the acceleration of an object to the net force actingon the object: ∑jFextj = ma , (7"
1)where the sum is over all the external forces acting on the system
The external forces are exactly the forces you have included in the free-body diagramof the object
 Often we refer to the sum of all the external force as the net externalforce:Fnet = ∑jFextj 
 (7
2)Inertial system: Newton’s second law is only valid in an inertial system
 If thereferences system is accelerated—either linearly or rotating—we cannot use New-ton’s law
Net external force: Newton’s second law is related to the net external force
" Externalforces are forces that have a cause outside the system, as we insisted on when you188 7 Forces in Two and Three DimensionsFig"

3 A sphere ishanging from two ropes thatare attached to the roof
" Inthis case, the net force is zeroeven when none of the forcespoint in the same direction,as shown by the graphicalvector summation to the rightGFA FBGFBFAdrew the free-body diagram of the system"
" You can therefore not use the law for asingle force alone—it is the net force that is causing the acceleration of the object,not one individual force acting on the system"
" For example, for the car driving up aninclined slope discussed above, the net force on the car is:Fnet = ∑jF j = N + f + D + G "
 (7
3)Net force is a vector sum: The net force is a vector sum of all the external forces
"Notice that the net force can be zero even if none of the force vectors point in thesame direction, as illustrated in Fig"
 7
3
Vector equation: Newton’s second law is a vector equation
" This means that it isvalid for each of the vector components independently:∑jFextj = ma , (7"
"4)implies that:∑jFextj,x = ma x , ∑jFextj,y = ma y , ∑jFextj,z = ma z , (7"
"5)where F j,x = F j · i and a x = a · i, and similarly for the other two components"
We can decompose Newton’s law along any set of axes we like
" We will see thatit is often useful to choose the axes wisely, for example by ensuring that the net forcealong one of the axis direction is zero, so that there is no change in motion in thisdirection"
"Notice that this means that the object can be accelerated in the x-direction, if thenet force in this direction is non-zero, while it moves with constant velocity in the7"
"2 Newton’s Second Law 189y-direction, if the net force in this direction is zero"
 The behavior along orthogonalaxes can therefore be completely decoupled
Superposition principle: Forces are subject to the superposition principle
 We canadd together or decompose forces as we like
" This allows us to subdivide a force,such as the surface interaction force, f, for the car driving up the hill, into severalforces, each representing a specific surface interaction term:f = ffriction + fadhesion + flubrication + "

"3 Force Model—Constant GravityAccording to Newton’s law of gravity, there is a gravitational force between anytwo objects with gravitational masses"
" For an object close to the Earth’s surface, thegravitational force on the object can be approximated as:G = −mg j , (7"
"7)where m is the gravitational mass of the object, g is the acceleration of gravity, andthe unit vector j points upwards"
 Upwards is indeed usually defined based on thedirection of the force from gravitation
" This constant gravity force model is valid aslong as the object does not move far away from the surface of the Earth, and as longas the object does not move too far along the surface of the Earth, since this wouldlead to a change in the unit vector j"
We notice that this force model is particularly simple: The force on an objectdue to gravity is a constant— both in magnitude and direction
" Our discussion ofthe constant gravity force model may be extended to any constant force, such as theforce on a charged particle in a homogeneous electric field"
"If you throw a ball from the ground, the only forces acting on the ball after it hasleft your hand are the force from gravity, G, and air resistance, D"
" It we neglect theeffect of air resistance, the only force acting on the ball is gravity"
 We can thereforeapply Newton’s second law to find the acceleration of the ball:∑jF j = G = mg j = ma ⇒ a = −g j 
 (7
"8)Since we have wisely chosen the y-axis to correspond to the direction of gravity,the acceleration of the ball is non-zero only in y-direction"
" The acceleration in thex- and z-directions are zero, and the velocities in these directions do therefore notchange"
 We call such a motion decoupled because the motion in the x- and y-axes areindependent of each other
 We will use this when we solve problems with constantforces

1 Example: Motion of a Ball with GravityThroughout this chapter we will follow a particular problem as we gradually increasethe complexity of the physical model: The motion of a ball thrown across the class-room
 The experiment is illustrated in Fig
 7
"4, which illustrates the observed path ofa ball in an experiment"
 How can we develop a realistic model for the motion of thisball? We start from the simplest description: The motion when affected by gravityalone
Problem: A ball is thrown from a height h above the ground at an angle α with thehorizontal with an initial speed v0 
 Find the velocity and position of the ball at atime t
"Identify and Sketch: In this exercise we address the motion of the ball, described bythe position r(t) as a function of time"
" At the time t0 , the ball was thrown"
" We placethe coordinate system so that gravity is acting in the y-direction, and we place thex-axis so that the ball is thrown in the positive x-direction"
" The origin is placed at theground, directly below the initial position of the ball at t = t0 "
 The initial positionvector is therefore r(t0) = r0 = h j
" The initial velocity is directed at an angle α withthe horizontal, this means that the initial velocity is v(t0) = v0 cos(α) i + v0 sin(α) j"
The situation is illustrated in Fig

3 Force Model—Constant Gravity 191Model: The motion of the ball is determined by the forces acting on it
" The onlycontact force acting on the ball is air resistance, FD , but we will here assume thatthis force is negligible"
" The only long-distance force acting on the ball is gravity, G,as illustrated in the free-body diagram in Fig"
 7
5
Newton’s second law is applied to both the x- and the y-component of the forcesindependently
 In the x-direction Newton’s second law gives:∑ Fx = ma x = 0 
 (7
9)There are no horizontal forces
" The sum of the forces in the horizontal, x-directionis therefore zero"
" Consequently, the acceleration in the x-direction, a x is also zero"
"Newton’s law of motion in the y-direction gives:∑ F y = G = −mg = ma y , (7"
"10)where we have used that the gravitational force from the Earth is mg, and that it actsin the negative y-direction"
"The acceleration of the ball is therefore:a = d2rdt2 = −g j , (7"
11)and the initial conditions are r(t0) = h j and v(t0) = v0 
Solve: We find the motion of the ball by solving the differential equation in (7
11)
"Since the acceleration is constant, we can solve it by direct integration for each ofthe components"
"In the x-direction, the acceleration is zero, and the velocity in this direction istherefore constant"
v x (t) = v x (t0) = v0 cos(α) 
 (7
12)The x-position is given by direct integration:v x (t) = dxdt (7
13)∫ tt0v x (t)dt =∫ tt0dxdt dt (7
14)∫ tt0v0 cos(α)dt =∫ xx(t0)(t)dx (7
15)v0 cos(α)(t − t0) = x(t) − x(t0) (7
"16)that is, we have recovered motion with constant velocity:x(t) = x(t0) = v0 cos(α)(t − t0) , (7"
"17)192 7 Forces in Two and Three DimensionsIn the y-direction, the acceleration is constant, a y = −g"
 We can find the velocityby direct integration:∫ tt0dv ydt dt =∫ tt0−gdt (7
18)v y (t) − v y (t0) = −g(t − t0) (7
19)which gives:v y (t) = (v0 sin(α) − g(t − t0)) (7
"20)We find the position by integrating once more, using that v y (t) = dy/dt, and thatv0,y = v0 sin(α):dydt = (v0,y − g(t − t0)) (7"
"21)∫ tt0dydt dt =∫ tt0(v0,y − g(t − t0)) dt (7"
"22)y(t) − y(t0) =∫ tt0v0,y dt − g∫ tt0(t − t0)dt (7"
"23)y(t) − y(t0) = v0,y (t − t0) − 12 g(t − t0)2 (7"
"24)which givesy(t) = h + v0 sin(α)(t − t0) − 12 g(t − t0)2 , (7"
25)where y(t0) = h is the launch height of the projectile
Analyze: We notice that the motion in the x- and y-directions are independent ofeach other
 The motion in the x-direction is simply a motion with constant velocity
The motion in the y-direction is the same as for the one-dimensional problem
" If theground is flat, it is the motion in the y-direction that determines how long time ittakes to reach the ground"
" We can therefore answer questions about flight time, andmaximum height by just studying the one-dimensional motion along the y-direction"
We have now found the complete solution for the motion of a ball subject only togravity
" From this solution, we can answer any complicated question, such as howfar the projectile travels or what choise of initial direction gives the maximum length"

"4 Force Model—Viscous ForceFor an object moving through a fluid, such as a projectile flying through the air,a meteor entering the Earth’s atmosphere, or a tiny microrobot navigating throughyour bloodstream, there is a contact force on the object due to the motion of the7"
4 Force Model—Viscous Force 193object relative to the fluid
" The fluid has to flow around the object when the objectmoves, as a result the fluid exerts a force on the object"
" This force is distributed: Itacts everywhere on the surface of the object, and it may also vary in magnitude anddirection along the surface of the object"
" Usually, we will simplify the effect of thethis distribution of forces into a single force acting in a single point on the object, andwe will call this force the drag force or the “fluid resistance” acting on the object"
For most purposes this is a sufficiently precise description of the interaction with thefluid
The form of the drag force depends on the velocity of the object relative to the fluid
"We discern between a behavior at low velocities, where the drag force is proportionalto the velocity, and high velocities, where the drag force depends on the square ofthe velocity:The drag force on an object moving at a velocity v relative to a fluid movingwith a velocity w is:FD { −k v (v − w) at small velocities−D |v − w| (v − w) at high velocities (7"
"26)The constant k v depends on the object’s size, shape and surface, as well as on the(dynamic) viscosity of the fluid"
 For a sphere Stokes found thatk v = 6π R η (7
"27)where R is the radius of the sphere, and η is the viscosity of the fluid"
 The viscosityof air is η = 1
82 × 10−5 Nsm−2 and for water it is η = 1

"Versatility of the viscous force model: The viscous force modelFD = −k vv , (7"
29)is much more versatile than suggested by its application to fluid drag forces
 It is oftenused as a general damping term—a term reducing relative motion that also introducesdissipation and heat generation
" For example, you will find that the viscous forcemodel used to model damping of vibrations in solid object, to model the dampingof vibrations in macroscopic objects and macroscopic springs, and to model surfaceforces in nano-scale surface contact"
 The viscous force model is a first order modelto study any velocity-dependent force that tends to reduce velocity differences

1 Example: Path Through a TornadoYou are part of a tornado-chaser team—a group of scientists trying to discover theinner workings of tornadoes
 An important part of this work is to develop methods tomeasure the pressure and wind velocity inside the tornado
 Your plan is to use manytiny projectiles with small accelerometers inside
" You plan to shoot the projectilesthrough the tornado, pick them up afterwards, and read the recorded accelerations"
"Here, we will assume that the accelerometers record the acceleration in the x, y, andz-direction during flight"
" Here, we will develop a model for the flight of the projectile,and calculate realistic trajectories in order to learn how to launch the projectiles"
"Sketch and Identify: Our task is to determine the motion of a projectile, character-ized by its position r(t)"
" For the calculations, we use a coordinate system with theorigin in the center of the tornado at ground level"
" The z-axis points in the verticaldirection, with the positive direction upwards"
" We will launch the projectile from theposition r(t0) = r0 with an initial velocity, v(t0) = v0 at t0 = 0"

Newton’s second law: Newton’s second law gives the acceleration of the projectile:ma = ∑jF j = FD + G

31)The acceleration is therefore:a = − Dm (v − u) |v − u| − g k

"Model of wind velocity: However, in order to test and analyze the path of theprojectile, we need a model for the velocity u in the tornado"
" Since we do not knowthis velocity-field, we will here use a model for the velocity taken from an analoguoussituation"
 We can make an experimental tornado by rotating a thin cylinder in a fluid
"For this case, we know that the velocity in the fluid will have the form:u(r) = u(r) ˆuθ , (7"

" The speed u(r) has the following form:u(r) ={ u0 (r∗/r) for r > r∗u0 (r/r∗) for r < r∗ , (7"

We use this as a model for the velocity field inside the tornado to estimate the pathof the projectile

Analysis: We now have a tool to start addressing the motion of the projectile insidethe tornado
 Let us use this to test the path of a projectile launched from a distanceof 100 m towards the center of the tornado with an initial speed v = 100 m/s
"Since the tornado is symmetric, we launch the projectile from the positionr0 = −100 m i"
" We fire the projectile at an angle of 45◦ with the horizon, whichcorresponds to an angle of π/4 in radians, since this gives the maximum length whenthere is no air-resistance"
 The initial velocity is therefore v0 = 100 m/s cos(π/4) i+100 m/s sin(π/4) j
 The resulting path is shown in Fig

The trajectory is hardly affected by the tornado
" How can we change the trajectoryto make it more sensitive to the wind speed? We could shoot it at an angle with thecenter, and not directly towards the center"
" This is attempted by introducing the angleθ, which gives the deviation from the line straight into the center"
 The initial velocityis now

" The next step would beto see how easy it would be to find the velocity field from these trajectories or froma set of trajectories, but we will not pursue this direction here"
 From our discussionyou should be able to see how we can use this model to address how to launch theprojectile
"Test your understanding: Based on this analysis, would you recommend launching the projectileby shooting it into the tornado, or by ejecting them vertically as the tornado is passing from acontainer ledged to the ground?7"
"5 Force Model—Spring ForceWhen we introduced the spring model in one dimension, it was used to representtwo different concepts:• To model the force from a linearly elastic spring• To represent the simplest position-dependent force modelBoth of these interpretations are still important in two- and three-dimensional sys-tems"
" We may use a spring model as a model for deformation, and we may use thespring model as a simplified model for a position-dependent force"
" However, wehave more degrees of freedom, and we can therefore define a spring model in severaldifferent ways"
198 7 Forces in Two and Three DimensionsFull Spring ModelLet us first see how the force due the deformation of a spring can be generalized intwo- and three-dimensions
" From one-dimensional experiments, we expect the forcefrom a spring on the object attached to the spring to depend on the elongation of thespring and act in the direction of the spring"
 The situation is illustrated in Fig
 7
8
" Aspring is characterized by its equilibrium length, L0 , and its spring constant, k"
" Theforce from the spring on the object is:F = −k (L − L0) ˆu r , (7"
"38)where L is the length of the spring, and the unit vector ˆu r points from the springtowards the object"
 (Check for yourself that the sign is indeed correct)
" If the objectis located at the position r, and the other end of the spring is attached to the point R,as in Fig"
 7
"8, the length of the spring is:L = |r − R| , (7"

"5 Force Model—Spring Force 199In the full spring model, the force from a spring attached to one end at R andat the other end to an object at r is:F = −k (L − L0) ˆu r , (7"
"41)where L = |r − R| is the length of the spring, and L0 is the equilibrium lengthof the spring"
"Often, we will place the origin at the attachment point of the spring, so that R = 0,and the full model simplifies to:F = −k (r − L0) rr , (7"
"42)where the length of the spring, L = r = |r|, is the distance from the origin to theparticle"
"We have named this model the “full model” because it most closely representsthe behavior of a real, physical spring"
 This force model is versatile and general andcan be widely applied
" For example, it can be used to model the deformation of anelastic body, or the force between two atoms in a molecule"
 This model will be ourpreferred model for contact forces such as forces due to deformation in two- andthree-dimensional systems
"Notice that the force model has a spherical symmetry: When we choose the originat the attachment point (R = 0), the force from the spring on the attached objectalways acts along a line through the origin, and the magnitude of the force dependson the distance r to the origin"
 This means that force on the particle from the springin the x-direction is:Fx = −k (r − L0) xr = −k(√x2 + y2 + z2 − L0) x√x2 + y2 + z2 
 (7
"43)That is, the force in the x-direction, depends not only on the x-position, but alsoon the y and z coordinates"
" If we apply Newton’s second law of motion to such asystem, the acceleration of the object in the x-direction, will depend on the x, y, andz coordinates of the object: We call such a system coupled, and notice that it maynot be that simple to find the solution to the equations of motion in this case"
Lattice Spring ModelWhile the full spring model has a simple physical interpretation—it models thebehavior of a physical spring—the resulting equations of motion are not that simple200 7 Forces in Two and Three DimensionsFig
 7
"9 An atom in a latticeis attached to four neighborsby linear springs, so that thesprings in the x-directiononly act in the x-direction,and the springs in they-direction only act in they-directionxyFxFyfrom a mathematical point of view, because the motion in the x, y, and z-directions arecoupled"
 It is therefore common to introduce a decoupled spring model
" The physicalanalogue of a decoupled system is found in a crystalline lattice: A central atom isattached with linear springs to four neighboring atoms, as illustrated in Fig"
 7
9
 Letus assume that the neighboring atoms do not move
"In the lattice spring model, the force on an object attached with springs in alldirections is:F = −k x (x − x e) i − k y (y − ye) j , (7"
"44)where x e and ye is the position of the atom when it is in equilibrium, and k xand k y are the spring constants in the x- and y-directions respectively"
 Thismodel is often referred to as the harmonic oscillator model 
"In this model, the forces in the x- and y-directions are independent of each other,which also means that the motion in the x- and y-directions are decoupled"
" Forexample, if the atom is only affected by the lattice spring force, Newton’s secondlaw gives:∑ F = k x (x − x e) i + k y (y − ye) j = m (a x i + a y j) (7"
"45)equating the components on each side therefore gives two, independent equations ofmotion for motion along the x- and y-axes:k x (x − x e) = ma x , k y (y − ye) = ma y (7"
46)This problem is mathematically much simpler than the full model: We can simplyuse the results we already found in the one-dimensional case

"1 Example: Motion of a Bouncing Ball with Air ResistanceIn this example we study the motion of an object subject to a constant force, a velocity-dependent force, and a position-dependent force"
 We solve the problem numericallyand discuss the results following a workflow similar to what you will find in manypractical problems
Let us continue to refine the description of a ball thrown in the classroom
 So farwe have introduced gravity and air resistance
 But what happens when the ball hitsthe floor? We need to also include a force model for the normal force from the flooron the ball
 The simplest approach to such a contact force model is a spring model:We model the interaction between the floor and the ball as a single spring
 But thenormal force is zero when there is no contact
 In this problem we demonstrate howto include such effects in our models
Problem: A ball is thrown from a height h above the ground with an initial velocityv0 
 Find the velocity and position of the ball as a function of time t
 Include thenormal force from the floor while the ball is in contact with the floor
"Identify and Sketch: We describe the position of the ball by r(t), measured in acoordinate system with origin at the floor"
" The initial position and velocity of theprojectile is r(t0) = h j and v(t0) = v0 = v x,0 i + v y,0 j"
"Model: The motion of the ball is determined by the forces acting: air resistance,FD , the normal force N from the floor, and gravity, G = −mg j, as illustrated in thefree-body diagram in Fig"

 We use a square law for air resistance:FD = −Dvv 
 (7
47)The normal force from the floor on the ball is represented by a spring force
 Thisis a strong simplification of the actual deformation process occurring at the contactbetween the ball and the floor due to the deformation of both the ball and the floor

" The depth of this region is Δy = R − y(t), where Ris the radius of the ball, which corresponds to the compression ΔL of the spring:N = −k (R − y(t)) j "
 (7
"48)We check that the sign is correct: The normal force must act upward when y < R,hence the sign must be negative"
"However, we must also ensure that the normal force only acts when the ball is incontact with the floor, otherwise the normal force is zero"
 The full formation of thenormal force is therefore:N ={ −k (R − y(t)) j when y(t) < R0 when y(t) ≥ R

"11, where it is compared with the path of the ball without airresistance"
Detailed analysis of wall contact: While the behavior in Fig
 7
"11 looks reasonableat first, a closer examination shows that something is wrong, at least according to ourintuition"
" When there is no air resistance, the ball bounces back to the same height!We know that a real ball would not behave like this"
 What is wrong?Figure 7
12 shows a magnification of the behavior of the ball during a bouncewhen there is no air resistance
 The red lines in the figures mark the positions andthe times when the ball comes in contact with the floor
" We see that the horizontalvelocity, v x , does not change at all during the bounce"
" This is not surprising, sincethe normal force only has a vertical component"
 No horizontal forces means nohorizontal acceleration
" However, we also see that the vertical velocity component,v y , simply reverses during the bounce"
 This is the part that strikes us as unrealistic
And indeed it is
 How can we modify the force model for the normal force to ensurethat the vertical speed is smaller after the collision? This question we will return tolater when we discuss energy and collisions
 The short answer is that we need tointroduce a force that is velocity dependent: Any force model that only depends on204 7 Forces in Two and Three Dimensions3

"The red lines illustrates the points where the ball comes in contact with the floorthe vertical position y(t) of the ball will always result in a reversal of the velocity!By introducing a viscous force, a linear velocity dependent force model, during thecollision with the floor, the outgoing vertical velocity will be reduced"
 But more onthis later! (See Chap
 12
")Comments: We have now built a model for a bouncing ball, including both airresistance and a normal force from the floor"
" You should notice the simple structurefollowed systematically: as long as we can develop force models for the interactions,we can model the motion"
" This method is robust and no different in one-, two-, or threedimensions"
 You should also notice that the normal force changes: It does not alwaysjust balance the gravitational force—it is indeed larger than the gravitational forcein parts of the collision
 Otherwise the normal force would not be able to change thedirection of the ball
" This simple point is a clear result of the force model approach,and also of a careful physical analysis, but represents a classical misunderstanding"

6 Force Model—Central Force 2057
"6 Force Model—Central ForceThe long-distance forces of gravitation and the electrostatic interaction (Coulomb’slaw) are examples of central forces: A force between two objects that:• acts in the center of the objects• acts along a line connecting the two objects• depends on the distance between the two objectsA central force has the form:F = F(r) rr = F(r) ˆu r , (7"
54)where the magnitude F(r) of the force is a function of the distance r only
"Both gravitation and the electrostatic force has the same form for the central force,the inverse square law:F = Cr2 ˆu r = C rr3 "
 (7
55)where for C = −Gm M this corresponds to Newton’s law of gravitation
"The central force model is a force between two objects, where we have placedone of the objects in the origin, and we are only interested in the motion of the otherobject"
" This corresponds to the case where the object in the origin is very massive,so that it does not move significantly, or where it is in some way attached, so that itdoes not move"
"Notice that the full spring model also is a central force model, but it does notdisplay the inverse square law"
" We can use the central force model to describe notonly gravitation and electrostatic interactions, but also for many interatomic forces,and as we have seen, for spring forces"

 We have also added the coordinate system in thecenter of the Sun
"Newton’s second law: Newton’s second law gives us the acceleration of the comet:ma = −G m M rr3 ⇒ a = −G M rr3 , (7"

" Generally, this problem requires a more advanced numerical solution methodin order to avoid inaccuracies—you should use a fourth order Runge-Kutta withadaptive time step—but we will here employ the Euler-Cromer scheme with a verysmall time step because of its transparent implementation"
"The Euler-Cromer scheme allows us to find the velocity and time after a smalltime-step Δt, starting from the initial condition at time t = t0 :v(t0 + Δt)  v(t0) + Δt a(t0, r(t0), v(t0)) (7"

"208 7 Forces in Two and Three DimensionsSummaryNewton’s second law:• Newton’s second law relates the acceleration of an object to the net forces actingon it: ∑j F j = ma, where the sum is over all forces acting on the object, and mis the inertial mass"
• All forces acting on a system has a source in the environment
• Forces can be contact forces acting on the boundary between the system and theenvironment
• Forces can be long range forces from an object in the environment
"• Forces are drawn as vectors starting at the point where the force is acting, pointingin the direction of the force, and with a length indicating the length of the force"
"• The force may be a given quantity, F"
• The gravitational force acts between all objects
" On the surface of the Earth thegravitational force on an object is W = −mg j, where j is a unit vector pointingupwards, g is the acceleration of gravity, and m is the gravitational mass"
 Thegravitational mass is equal to the inertial mass
• The contact force from a fluid on a moving object depends on the velocity ofthe object relative to the fluid
" The simplest force model is the viscous force,D = −k vv, where the constant k v depends on the viscosity of the fluid and the sizeof the object"
• The contact force from a solid depends on the distance between the object and thesolid
 The simplest force model that depends on the position of an object is theindependent spring force model: F = −k x (x − x e) i − k y (y − ye) j − k z (z − z e) k
"Here, x e, ye, z e are equilibrium positions in the x, y, and z-directions, and k x , k y ,and k z are spring constants"
 The spring model is one of the most fundamental forcemodels because it is the first order Taylor expansion of any position-dependentforce
Problem-solving approach:• We identify the object and its initial conditions
"• We model the behavior by find the forces acting on the object, introducing forcemodels for all the forces, and applying Newton’s second law to find an equationfor the acceleration of the object"
• We solve the problem by finding the position and velocity from the accelerationand the initial conditions using numerical or analytical techniques
"• We analyze the solution to validate it, and use the solution to answer the originalquestion posed"

"(c) Rewrite the expression of the external force on component form by writing theforce components, Fx , and F y , as functions of the components x and y of the positionvector, r(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j"
"In this project, we will not assume that the ball is following a particular path, suchas a circle, but we will instead use Newton’s second law to determine the motion ofthe ball from the forces acting on it"
" Using our model, we can measure the tensionin the rope, as well as the motion of the ball, and analyze these to learn about themotion"

"(e) If the ball is at rest at θ = 0 with no velocity (v = 0) and no acceleration, whatis the position of the ball? What happens if you increase the value of k for the rope?We will now study a specific pendulum, consisting of a ball with a mass of 0"
"1 kg,and a rope of equilibrium length L0 = 1 m with a spring constant k = 200 N/m,which corresponds to a rather elastic rope"
" Initially, you can assume that the ball starts212 7 Forces in Two and Three Dimensionswith zero velocity at an angle θ = 30◦ at a distance L0 from the origin"
 We want tostudy the motion of the ball by integrating the equations of motion numerically
"(f) Find an expression for the acceleration, a, of the ball"

 Hint 2:Remember that r = r(t) = |r(t)| varies in time! Hint 3: Do not use θ(t) to describethe position of the ball

" Are your results reasonable? Based on this, canyou suggest how to use this method to model a pendulum in a stiff rope? What doyou think would be the limitation of this approach? (Test what happens if you usek = 2 10 6 in your program)"

"(o) What is the terminal velocity of the balloon now?Chapter 8Constrained MotionIn many cases, the object we are studying is not free to move in every direction"
" Forexample, a bead on a wire can only move along the wire"
" The shape and position ofthe wire determine the path of the bead, but the bead is still free to move in manydifferent ways along that wire"
 In this case we call the motion “constrained”
" Theconstraints can be strong, by restricting the motion to be along a given path, or theconstraints can be weak, such as for a bead caught between two parallel glass plates,or for a car driving on the terrain"
" Constraints may also arise because objects areconnected to each other: The motion of an individual atom in a large rigid moleculeis constrained by the motion of the whole molecule, and a small part of a spinningwheel is constrained to follow the motion of the wheel"
We have learned that the motion of an object can be determined from the forcesacting on the object
" This is, of course, also the case for constrained motion"
" Butin many cases it is not practical to include the forces that restrict the motion, eitherbecause we do not have good models for them, or because we would rather like todetermine these constraining forces from what we know about the motion—fromthe fact that the object follows a particular path"
" For example, a bead moving alonga wire will be affected by normal forces from the wire on the bead, and it is theseforces that cause the bead to follow the path given by the wire"
" However, we may notwant to model these forces in detail, instead we are interested in the consequences ofconstraints—we want to find the normal force when we know that the bead followsthe wire"
"In this chapter, we will discuss constrained motion"
" Starting from the simplestcase of motion constrained to a line, through circular motion, to motion constrainedto be along a general curve"

"We can also formulate the constraint without fixing the x-axis to be along thedirection of motion, such as for the train in Fig"

 The train moves along a slopethat forms the angle θ with the horizon
 We can describe the slope by the point Rand the unit vector ˆu = cos θ i + sin θ j which points along the slope
" The positionof the train is then given by how far along the slope it has moved, s(t):r(t) = R + ˆu s(t) "
 (8
"2)We call s(t) the distance, and notice that it would correspond to the coordinate x′ ofa coordinate system oriented along the slope"
" Since R is a constant, the velocity ofthe train isdrdt = dRdt︸︷︷︸=0+ ˆu dsdt = ˆu dsdt , (8"
"3)where ds/dt is the velocity measured along the track, which is what you wouldmeasure from a speedometer"
 The distance s(t) traveled reflects the motion of thebead

The velocity vector is the time derivative of theposition vector:v = drdt = limΔt→0r(t + Δt) − r(t)Δt = limΔt→0ΔrΔt "
 (8
4)We see from Fig
 8
"2c that as the time interval Δt decreases, the displacement Δrbecomes tangential to the curve, just as we found in Chap"
" 6:v(t) = v(t) ˆu T , (8"
"5)where ˆu T (t) is the unit tangent vector, ˆu T = v/|v|"
" We also see that as Δt becomessmall, the arc length along the curve, Δs becomes approximately the same as thedisplacement Δr = |Δr|:Δr → Δs when Δt → 0 "
 (8
6)The magnitude of the velocity therefore approachesv = |Δr|Δt = ΔrΔt → ΔsΔt → dsdt 
 (8
7)when Δt → 0
" Now, we know both the direction and the magnitude of the velocity:Velocity of motion along a curve:v(t) = v(t) ˆu T (t) = dsdt ˆu T (t) "
 (8
"8)Notice that the unit vector ˆu T is not a constant, but changes with time as theobject moves: ˆu T = ˆu T (t)"
Acceleration VectorThe acceleration of the train can be found by taking the time derivative of the velocityvector:a = ddt v(t) ˆu T (t) = dvdt ˆu T + v(t) d ˆu Tdt 
 (8
9)We recognize the first component as the rate of change of the magnitude of thevelocity—this is how the speedometer changes as the train accelerates

2 Curved Motion 219What about the second term? We have illustrated a small part of a motion inFig
 8
2d
 We are interested in the change in the tangent vector from the point A atr(t) to the point A′ at r(t + Δt)
" We have illustrated the tangent vectors, and in thesmall inset, we have illustrated the change in the tangent vectors, Δ ˆu T "
" For a smallincrement Δt, we argue that the length of the Δ ˆu T vector is approximately given asthe length of the arc between the two tangent vectors, which is the angle Δφ betweenthe two vectors multiplied by the length of the vectors, which is 1"
" Now, we can relatethe angle Δφ to the local geometry of the curve by drawing a line AB normal to thetangent vector in A, and a line A′ B normal to the tangent vector in A′"
" This forms atriangle that is congruent with the small triangle formed by the tangent unit vectors,the angle spanned by the two lines AB and AB′ is therefore Δφ"
" The length of ABand AB′ is called the radius of curvature, ρ"
" The angle Δφ is also given as the arclength from A to A′, which is the distance Δs along the trajectory, divided by thelocal radius ρ:Δφ = Δsρ "
 (8
"10)The direction of the change in the unit tangent vector is toward the center of thecircle, that is, toward the point B"
" We call this direction the normal direction, andwe call the unit vector pointing in this direction for the unit normal vector, ˆu N "
 Thechange in the tangent vector is therefore:Δ ˆu T = |Δ ˆu T | ˆu N = Δφ ˆu N = Δsρ ˆu N 
 (8
11)The time derivative of the tangent vector is therefore:d ˆu T (t)dt = limΔt→0Δu TΔt = limΔt→0ΔsρΔt ˆu N = v(t) 1ρ(t) ˆu N (t) 
 (8
"12)Now, we insert this expression back into the expression for the acceleration in (8"
"9),gettinga(t) = dvdt ˆu T (t) + v2(t)ρ(t) ˆu N (t) "
 (8
"13)Here, we write that the radius of curvature, ρ(t), is a function of time, because theradius of curvature is a function of the position along the curve, ρ(s), and the positionalong the curve for the object is a function of time, s = s(t): ρ(t) = ρ(s(t))"
"We have therefore shown that the acceleration vector can be written asa(t) = a T (t) ˆu T (t) + a N (t) ˆu N (t) , (8"
"14)220 8 Constrained Motionwhere the tangential acceleration isa T (t) = dvdt , (8"
15)and the normal acceleration isa N (t) = v2(t)ρ 
 (8
"16)The magnitude of the normal acceleration, a N = v2/ρ is often called the sentripetalacceleration of the object"
"Uniform Circular MotionThese results can be simplified for uniform circular motion, where an object movesin a circle with a constant speed, v"
" In this case, the speed v(t) does not change,and the radius of curvature is constant and equal to the radius, R, of the circle"
" Theacceleration is therefore a N = v2/R, directed in towards the center of the circle"
This is illustrated by the motion diagram in Fig
 8

Non-uniform Circular MotionFigure 8
3 illustrates a motion diagram for a non-uniform circular motion: One casewhere the speed is increasing and one case where the speed is decreasing
" In bothcases, the radius of curvature is constant and equal to the radius, R, of the circle"
 Theacceleration is thereforea = dvdt ˆu T + v2R ˆu N 
 (8
17)Angular CoordinatesWe can also specify a position on the circle by the angle φ(t) as illustrated in Fig
 8

How are the distance s(t) and the angle φ(t) related? The distance s(t) correspondsto the arc length along the circle:s(t) = Rφ(t) 
 (8
"18)The two representations s(t) or φ(t) can both be used to represent the position, andyou may use whatever representation you find most practical"
"The speed can be related to the rate of change of the angle, φ, sincedsdt = ddt (Rφ(t)) = R dφdt = Rω(t) , (8"

2 Example: Acceleration of a Rotating RodProblem: A rod of length L is rotating around an axis through one of its ends
 Therod is rotating at a constant speed so that it takes a time T for the rod to complete arevolution
 (a) Find the speed of a point P on the rod located a distance R from therotation axis
 (b) Find the acceleration of the point P
Solution: The rotating rod is illustrated in Fig
 8

 The point P is located a distanceR from the rotation axis
" Since the rod is rotating at a constant speed, the speed of thepoint P on the rod is also constant, and the average speed is equal to the instantaneousspeed"
 We find the average speed over a complete revolution from the length the pointhas traveled during a complete revolution and the time a revolution takes
" The rodcompletes a revolution in a time T , and the point P has moved a distance s = 2π Ralong the whole, closed circular loop"
" We find the average speed of P as:v = sT = 2π RT = 2πT R , (8"
"21)The quantity 2π/T is often called the angular frequency, or, as we will see later, theangular velocity, and we usually use the symbol ω for this:ω = 2πT , (8"

2 Curved Motion 223We find the acceleration of the point P by realizing that the point moves along acircular path of radius R and with a speed v
" The acceleration is therefore directedin toward the center of the circle, which is also the rotation axis, and the magnitudeof the acceleration is given by the centripetal acceleration term:a = v2R = (Rω)2R = Rω2 = R( 2πT)2"

" (a)If the ball is spun at a constant speed of v = 2 m/s, find the tangential and normalacceleration of the ball"
" (b) If the ball starts at rest and increases its speed at a constantrate, dv/dt = 0"
"1 m/s 2 , find the tangential and normal accelerations of the ball as afunction of time"
"Solution (a): The acceleration of the ball has a tangential and a normal component:a T = dvdt , a N = v2ρ "
 (8
"25)Because the speed is constant, we have that dv/dt = 0, and the tangential accelerationis zero"
" The radius of curvature, ρ for a circular path with radius R is the radius ofthe circle, ρ = R"
 The tangential acceleration is therefore:a N = v2ρ = (2 m/s)21 m = 4 m/s2 
 (8
26)Solution (b): The speed of the ball is v(t)
" We know that the speed of the ball isv(0) = 0 m/s when t = 0 s, and that dv/dt = 0"

 Comparethe two accelerations throughout the motion and comment on the results
Chapter 9Forces and Constrained MotionYou have now learned to determine the motion of an object based on an analysis ofthe forces acting on the object and the application of Newton’s second law
" We usethe structured problem-solving approach to first identify the moving object, modelthe forces acting to produce an equation of motion, solve the equations of motion tofind the motion, and analyze the results to answer questions about the motion"
 Thismethod is very robust—it works as long as we have good models for all the forces
"For example, if you drop a steel box onto a wooden table, you have learned touse a spring model to approximate the normal force from the table on the box whilethe two are in contact, as illustrated in Fig"
 9
1
" The normal force, N , depends on theposition, x, of the bottom of the box:N ={ −kx x < 00 x ≥ 0 (9"
"1)However, if the box is lying at rest on the table, we do not need a force model to findthe normal force on the box"
" We can instead use our knowledge about the motionof the box—we know that it is not moving—and apply Newton’s second law todetermine the normal force, N , to be equal to the gravitational force, G, on the box:∑ F = N − G = ma = 0 ⇒ N = G "
 (9
2)In this case the motion of the box is constrained: We know that it is not moving inthe direction of gravity
" For constrained motion we can therefore calculate some ofthe forces without a force model!First, why is this interesting? If we already know that the box is not moving inthe direction of gravity, why would we need to know the forces acting on the boxin this direction? Was not the whole point of introducing quantitative models for theforces that we could use this to determine the motion? It turns out that some forcemodels, such as the model for friction, depends on the normal force on the object"
" Inthis case, we need to know the normal force to find the force acting in the direction© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015A"

1 Illustration of a box in contact with a surface
" Left figure shows the gravitational, G, andnormal force, N , on the box when the box is released from a small height above the floor"
 Rightfigure shows the gravitational and normal force when the box is lying (almost) still on the floor
 Theforces and vertical motion of the box has been exaggeratedof the motion
" Also, there are many cases where the motion is constrained only fora certain range of normal forces: For example, the attachment of a roller coaster cartmay only sustain a certain maximum force before breaking, or the motion of a ball ina rope is only constrained by the rope as long as the rope is tight"
 In both these casesit is an advantage if we can find forces such as the normal force without introducinga force model
"Second, you may object that it is not really true that the box is not moving in thedirection of gravity"
" The box is never completely at rest on the table, it still oscillatesslightly up and down, and the normal force varies slightly"
" That is correct, but wealways make many similar approximations"
" Generally, if the oscillations are verysmall, we ignore them, and the corresponding variation in forces, and assume thatthe motion is constrained"
In this chapter we will discuss the use of constrained motion to simplify problems
"First, we demonstrate how we try to choose coordinate systems wisely so that motiononly occurs along some of the axes"
" This technique is often called “decomposition offorces”, and it simplifies the analysis of a problem, because only force componentsin the directions that the object can move can contribute to the acceleration of theobject along its path"
"We will also introduce a new force model, the friction force model, which allowsus to model forces during the relative motion of two solids"
" This model has a longhistory and allows us to study many classical examples, even though the physicalorigin of friction forces is poorly understood"
"We will also study more complicated constrained motions, such as the circularmotion of an object attached to a rope, or the motion of a car driving along a curvedroad or a hilltop"
" In these cases the constraints are only valid for a limited range ofthe normal forces, and care must be taken to find when the limits are exceeded"

1 Linear ConstraintsNo Motion—StaticsLet us start with the simplest example of a constrained motion—an object that is notmoving at all
" In this case, we are not interested in determining the motion of theobject, but instead we want to find the forces acting on the object from the constraintthat the object is not moving, and that the net force on the object therefore is zero"
"Such problems are typically called equilibrium problems, or static problems"
"For example, let us analyze a car standing on the ground, as illustrated in Fig"

We follow the first steps in the structured problem-solving approach
" First, we identifythe object, which in this case is the car"
"Second, we model the interactions between the object and the environment byidentifying the forces acting on the object and by introducing quantitative modelsfor the forces"
 The free-body diagram for the car is illustrated in Fig

" The onlycontact forces are acting on the wheels of the car from the ground, and we call thesecontact forces N1 and N2 "
" 1 In addition, there is a gravitational force, G"
 Both thenormal forces and the gravitational force act in the y-direction only
"We have a quantitative model for the gravitational force, G = −mg j, where mis the mass of the car"
" However, we do not know the normal forces"
" Instead, we willuse Newton’s second law to determine the forces given the constraint we have on themotion—the car is not moving"
"Because the car is not moving, the acceleration of the car is zero, a = 0"
 Newton’ssecond law therefore gives:∑ F = N1 + N2 + G = m a = 0

 b Free-body diagram for the carWe have found that the sum of the normal forces equals the opposite of thegravitational force
"Generally, we do not know how the total normal force is divided between the nor-mal forces"
" 2 For example, if the car has a very large load in the luggage room in theback, we expect the back suspensions to be more compressed than the front suspen-sions, which suggest that the normal force on the back of the car is larger than on thefront of the car"
" On the other hand, if the engine in the front of the car is very heavy,we would expect the front wheels to experience a larger load than the back wheels"
"It is therefore common to only draw a single contact point for the car, where thesum, N, of the normal forces are acting:N = N1 + N2 "
 (9
"5)Equilibrium Along One Axis, Motion Along the OtherLet us now look at a slightly more complicated problem, a car moving in a straightline along a flat surface, as illustrated in Fig"
 9
3
" In this case the motion of the caris constrained to a line, and the forces acting on the car are either directed along theline or are normal to the line"
" Notice that since the car is constrained to move alonga line, the acceleration normal to the line is zero"
"Let us analyze the motion of the car when a horizontal force F is applied, as showin Fig"

 The forces acting on the car are illustrated in Fig

" The contact forcesare the two normal force, N1 and N2 , as we introduced above, the externally appliedforce, F, acting horizontally, and the gravitational force G"
 We assume that the effectsof friction and air resistance are negligible
"We have a force model for the gravitational force, G = −mg j, and we assumethat we know the value of the externally applied force, F"
"2 As we will see later, we can determine each of the normal forces by making a similar assumptionabout the rotation of the car: the car is not rotating"
9
1 Linear Constraints 233We can determine both the motion of the object and the normal forces by applyingNewton’s second law
" We recall that Newton’s law is a vector equation, and that itcan be applied along each unit vector independently:∑ F = N1 + N2 + G + F = ma "
 (9
6)N1j + N2j − Gj + Fi = ma = ma x i + ma y j 
 (9
"7)This can be written as two sets of equations, one for motion along the x-axis, andone for motion along the y-axis:F = ma xN1 + N2 + G = ma y (9"
"8)Since the car is moving along the x-axis, the acceleration along the y-axis is zero:N1 + N2 + G = ma y = 0 , (9"
9)andN1 + N2 = −G = mg 
 (9
10)The forces in the y-direction are therefore the same as we found above
"The motion in the x-direction is given by the forces acting in the x-direction, aswe have found previously"
"This analysis demonstrates how we decompose the motion into• motion along the constraint, and• motion normal to the constraint"
"This is done through the analysis of force, where we similarly decompose theforces into• forces along the constraint, and• forces normal to the constraint"
In this particular case all forces are acting either along or normal to the line ofconstraint
" Consequently, the analysis is particularly simple"
"Decomposition of ForcesWe are now ready to add one more complication, and address motion where theexternal forces are not simply parallel to or normal to the motion, but where there are234 9 Forces and Constrained Motion(a) (b)Fig"

 b Free-body diagram for the carforce components both parallel to and normal to the motion
" In this case, the use ofdecomposition of forces becomes more important, and we will demonstrate how weuse this technique combined with the application of Newton’s second law throughan example"
"Let us study the motion of a car rolling down an inclined slope, as illustrated inFig"
 9
4
 We realize that also in this case the car is constrained to move along thesurface of the slope
 We determine the motion of the car by identifying and modelingthe forces acting on the car
" The contact forces on the car are the normal force, N1and N2 "
 These act normal to the surface
 We have chosen the coordinate systemto be oriented along the inclined slope so that the x-axis points in the direction ofmotion—what we called along the constraint—and the y-axis points in a directionnormal to the constraint
 We assume that we can neglect the effects of friction andair resistance
"In addition, the car is subject to a gravitational force, G"
" The gravitational forceis directed along the vertical axis, which we have called the y′-axis in Fig"
 9
4
"We decompose the forces in the x- and y-directions, parallel and normal to thedirection of motion for the car"
" We notice that the normal forces are directed alongthe y-axis:N1 = N1 j , N2 = N2 j "
 (9
"11)The gravitational force, G, is not parallel to the x- or the y-axis, but we can decomposeit into two components along these directions"
 From Fig
 9
"4 we see that the x- andy-components of gravity can be written as:G x = G sin α , G y = −G cos α "
 (9
12)The gravitational force is therefore:G = G x i + G y j 
 (9
"13)where the gravitational force model gives the value, G = mg, for the gravitationalforce on the car"
9
"1 Linear Constraints 235Notice that we have decomposed the forces in the direction of motion, which isgiven by the constraint, and in the direction normal to motion"
" This allows us to applyNewton’s laws of motion in each direction, separating the motion along the surfacefrom motion normal to the surface"
We apply Newton’s second law of motion to the car:∑ F = N1 + N2 + G = m a 
 (9
14)We write the vectors on component form:N1 j + N2 j + G x i + G y j = ma x i + ma y j 
 (9
"15)We can separate this into two equations, one equation for the x-axis and one equationfor the y-axis:G x = ma x (9"
16)N1 + N2 + G y = ma y (9
"17)Because we know that the car is only moving along the surface, the acceleration inthe y-direction is zero, giving:N1 + N2 = −G y = G cos α = mg cos α "
 (9
18)We have therefore found that sum of normal forces on the car balances the componentof the gravitational force that is normal to the surface
We find that motion along the x-axis is determined by:a x = G xm = mg sin αm = g sin α 
 (9
19)We can therefore use our tools to solve motion with constant acceleration to find themotion along the x-axis
Notice the use of decomposition: We choose a coordinate system so that one ormore axes are directed in a direction where we know that there is no motion
Above we chose the y-axis to be directed normal to the surface and the x-axis to be along the direction of motion
 We apply Newton’s second law inthe directions where there are no motion to determine the other forces in thisdirection
" Then, we find force components in the direction of motion, whichdetermine the acceleration and hence the motion of the object along the surface"
"This approach is general, and can be applied to a wide range of problems wheremotion is constrained to a line"

1 Example: A Bead in the WindProblem: A bead is sliding without friction along a vertical wire
 A wind with aconstant wind speed of w is blowing horizontally
 Find the force from the wire onthe bead and the acceleration of the bead
 You can use a linear air resistance law forthe bead
"Approach: We find the net force along the bead, including the effect of air resistance,and use this to find the acceleration along the wire and the forces normal to the wirefrom Newton’s second law"
"Identify: The center of the bead, given by r(t), must move along the wire"
" Wetherefore choose the y-axis to be along the wire in the vertical direction, and thex-axis to be directed in the direction the wind is blowing"
 (See Fig
 9
5a)
"Model: The contact forces on the bead are the force from the wire on the bead, N;the air drag force, FD ; and gravity G = −mg j"
" The air drag force depends on thevelocity v of the bead relative to the velocity w of the wind:FD = −k v (v − w) , (9"
20)These forces are illustrated in the free-body diagram for the bead in Fig
 9
5b
We decompose in the x- and y-direction
" Gravity acts vertically, and thereforealong the y-axis"
" The air drag depends on the velocity, v, of the bead"
" Since the beadmoves only in the vertical direction, along the wire, the velocity only has a verticalcomponent:v = v y j "
 (9
21)The velocity of the air is in the positive x-direction:w = w i 
 (9

"1 Linear Constraints 237The air drag force is therefore:FD = F D,x i + F D,y j , (9"
"23)where we find Fx from:F D,x = FD · i = −k v (v − w) · i = −k v (v · i − w · i) = −k v (0 − w) = k v w(9"
"24)And, similarly, we find the y-component:F D,y = FD · j = −k v v y , (9"
"25)We also notice that the normal force, N, only has a component along the x-axis"
" Wehave now decomposed the forces, and can apply Newton’s second law along the x-and y-directions"
"Since the bead is constrained not to move in the x-direction, we know that theacceleration in the x-direction is zero"
" Newton’s law along the x-axis therefore gives:∑ Fx = F D,x − N = ma x = 0 ⇒ N = F D,x = k v w "
 (9
"26)The normal force is therefore constant for this particular model of the motion!We find the acceleration of the bead by applying Newton’s law in the y-direction:∑ F y = F D,y − G = −k v v y − mg = ma y ⇒ a y = − k vm v y − g "
 (9
27)From these equations you know how to find the motion of the bead
" For this particularformulation of the problem, it is decoupled—the motion of the bead in the y-directiondoes not depend on the wind velocity"
Test your understanding: How would this problem change if you used a square-law for the airdrag?9

6 Left Illustration of a crate on the floor
 Right A free-body diagram of a crate on the floor
You are trying to push the crate with the force F directed along the floorBut so far there has been no coupling between the forces normal to the surface andthe forces along the surface—the tangential forces
 The magnitude of the normalforce has no impact on the motion of the block
In real systems there are several mechanisms that introduce a coupling between thenormal and tangential forces
 When we discuss macroscopic systems it is commonto group these mechanisms into a common term: friction
" Friction is a force actingon the contact between two objects, it acts tangential to the contact, and it dependson the magnitude of the normal force at this contact"
 The introduction of a forcemodel for friction forces is therefore essential in order to get a realistic descriptionof contact forces
" Unfortunately, the concept of friction is not that well defined"
" Themechanisms of friction are currently not well understood, and are subjects of currentresearch"
" There is also not only one, single mechanism responsible for the tangentialforces acting on a contact—there are many different mechanisms acting all at thesame time, including effects such as surface geometry and roughness, the effect ofthin fluid films, surfactants, and dirt on the surfaces, the effect of adhesion forcesand plastic deformation of small asperities on the contact surface, the effect of theexternal boundaries, and many more"
" In addition, it is also clear that the scale you arestudying is important: For example on very small scales inter-atomic forces and thepresence of individual atoms or molecules along the surface can affect the tangentialforces acting"
"But wait, you interrupt, I already know something about friction, and it is a simplelaw! Yes"
 Already in 1699 Amontons reported the experimental observations that wetoday also call the “laws of friction”:Amonton’s laws of dynamic friction:• The friction force is proportional to the normal force: F = μN 
• The friction force does not depend on the apparent contact area
"This is an experimental observation that turns out to be surprisingly robust, in par-ticular considering that it includes so many different effects! In this section we willmotivate and discuss the force model for friction as a contact force acting in the tan-gential direction along any contact between two solids"
 We will introduce a model for9
"2 Force Model—Friction 239the static friction force for the case when the two surfaces are not moving relative toeach other, and a model for the dynamic friction force when the surfaces are movingrelative to each other"
Static FrictionWe all have a good intuition for solid friction because it is an important force in ourmacroscopic world
" If you want to push a heavy crate along the floor, you know thatyou need to apply a certain force to “get it going”"
" If you do not push hard enough,it will not start moving"
" You may also know that if you want to keep it moving, youmust constantly apply a force to it, otherwise it will stop moving"
" If you give the cratea hard push, it will start moving, but you know that it will decelerate and stop aftersome distance"
 These simple insights provides us with some of the basic propertiesof a the friction forceSliding box model system: Let us analyze the motion of a crate on a flat floor in detail(See Fig
 9
6 for an illustration)
" You push on the crate with a horizontal force, F"
"The motion of the crate is determined by the forces acting on it: The applied force, F,the normal force N from the floor, and the gravitational force, G"
 The crate is cannotmove down through the floor—it is constrained not to move in the y-direction
 Wecan therefore use Newton’s second law in the y-direction to determine the normalforce:∑ F y = N − G = N − mg = ma y = 0 ⇒ N = mg 
 (9
"30)We also know, from our experience or from staging a simple experiment, that whenthe applied force, F, is small, the crate is not moving in the horizontal direction"
"However, according to Newton’s second law of motion the horizontal accelerationis given by the net horizontal force:∑ Fx = ma x "
 (9
"31)Because the crate is not moving, the sum of the forces must be zero"
" Consequently,the crate cannot only be affected by the applied force F in the horizontal direction"
"There must be an additional force, counteracting the applied force"
 This force mustcome from the contact with the floor
" And the force has the apparently “magical”property that it is exactly equal to the applied, horizontal force! If you push with avery small force, F0 , then the force from the floor will be exactly the same but in theopposite direction"
" If you push with a slightly larger force, F1 , then the force fromthe floor will again be exactly the same, but in the opposite direction"
" In this respectthe friction force is similar to the normal force from the floor on the crate, which inthe static situation matches the force from gravity"
 We call the force from the flooron the crate the static friction force240 9 Forces and Constrained MotionMicroscopic model for static friction: The word static indicates that it is the frictionalong a surface when the object does not move relative to the surface
 We can developa simple model for the origin of the static friction force from a microscopic pictureof the contact
" On the microscopic scale, the contact between the crate and the floorconsists of many, small irregularities: small bumps on the surface of the floor and thesurface of the crate"
" When the crate is placed on the surface, these irregularities arepressed together"
" One possible explanation is that in this process, the irregularitiesare “glued” together due to adhesive forces between the two materials"
" This glue actslike small springs, so that when we try to push at the crate, these small springs areextended, exerting forces that counteract the applied force"
" However, if the appliedforce on the crate becomes too large, the adhesive forces become so large that thecontacts break, and the crate starts to slip"
"It is reasonable to assume that the number of irregularities that are in contact,and possibly the contact area of each irregularity, increase with the normal force"
"This means that we should discern between the apparent area of contact, which issimply the size of the side of crate facing the floor, and the actual area of contact,which is given by the contact areas of all the small irregularities"
" If the actual contactarea is proportional to the normal force, we expect the static friction force also to beproportional to the normal force"
"The simple model we have developed now, based only on our intuition, is surpris-ingly close to the most usual description of static friction"
" By the word “law” here,we mean a model for the force — it is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather amodel that can often, but not always, be applied to contact problems"
"Coefficient of static friction: The upper limit of the static friction force is Fm =μs N , where N is the normal force for the contact, and μs is called the coefficientof static friction"
" If the friction force exceeds this upper limit, the object will startmoving relative to the surface, and our model for static friction is no longer valid"
We see that the concept of static friction is closely related to a constraint on themotion of an object:The static friction force is a tangential force acting on the interface betweentwo solids in contact that are not moving relative to each other
 The magnitudeand direction of the force is so that the two object do not accelerate relativeto each other
" However, there is an upper limit on the magnitude of the staticfriction forceFs < Fs,max = μs N , (9"
32)where N is the normal force at the contact
"In order to determine the static friction force we need to assume that the objectsare not accelerating, that is, we need to assume a constraint on the motion, and useNewton’s second law of motion to determine the static friction force"
" Then, we need9"

7 Left Illustration of a crate moving along the floor
 Right A free-body diagram of a crateon the floor
 You are pushing the crate with the force F directed along the floorto check that the force does not exceed the threshold
" If it exceeds the threshold, theobjects will start moving relative to each other, and we need another force model—thedynamic friction model"
"This law is experimentally justified and it is only an approximation of the realbehavior of materials, where many different effects contribute to bring about theeffect of a static friction force"
Dynamic FrictionYou are gradually increasing how hard you are pushing a crate on the floor
 Whathappens when the crate slips? Our model so far has been for static friction
" However,you know from your own experience that if you give the crate an initial velocityand release it along the floor, it slows downs and stops (see Fig"
 9
7)
 That meansthat the crate decelerates
" We can therefore use Newton’s second law and concludethat because the crate decelerates, there must be a force acting along the floor in thedirection opposite the movement, which is the cause of the deceleration"
 We call thisforce the dynamic friction force
"There is a surprisingly simple law for the dynamic friction force, Fd , acting onan object in contact with another object:The dynamic friction force, Fd , is tangential to the surface of contact"
 Themagnitude of the force is Fd = μd N where N is the normal force across thecontact
 The direction of the force is opposite the relative motion of the twoobjects
This law is empirically based
 This means that it is the result of measurements
" Thelaw states that the dynamic friction force depends only on the normal force andon the coefficient of friction, which is a property of the two materials in contact"
The dynamic friction force does not depend on the area of contact
 Neither doesit depend on the velocity of the object relative to the floor
 This is surprising—we242 9 Forces and Constrained MotionFig

The coefficient of static friction between the book and the table is μs = 2/3
 Whatis the friction force on the book? At what tilting angle will the book start to slide?Approach: Does the book move? We start from the assumption that the book is notmoving—a special case of constrained motion—and check if the conditions for staticfriction are fulfilled
" If they are not fulfilled, the book starts to slide"

 (9
"34)As long as the book is not moving, F is a result of static friction"
 But there is a limiton the static friction force: f < fmax = μs N 
" If the static friction force exceeds thislimit, the book starts to slide"

"2 Force Model—Friction 243First, let us check if the static friction force is exceeded when α = 30◦ andμs = 2/3"
" In this case cos α = √3/2,N = mg cos α =√32 mg , (9"
35)and the maximum static friction force is:fmax = μs N = 23√32 mg =√33 mg

37)which is smaller than the maximum friction force
 The book does not slide
Let us find at what angle the book starts to slide
 Sliding occurs when the frictionforce becomes equal to the maximum friction force
" For smaller angles than this,the book does not slide, but for an angle large than this, the book starts sliding"
" Thisangle is called the angle of marginal stability, αm "
 It is found fromf = fm (9

 (9
41)We should check if this result is reasonable by testing the behavior for large andsmall values of μs 
" When μs is small, αm is also small, which is the correct behavior,When μs becomes very large, αm approaches π/2, which is also the correct result"

" We call the sum of both of theseforces, F, which acts along the slope, in the x-direction"
 The rock is also in contactwith the sand slope
" There is a normal force, N , from the slope on the rock, and thereis friction force acting along the slope from the slope on the rock"
" Because the rockis moving relative to the slope, we use the dynamic friction model for the frictionforce, f = μd N , acting in the negative x-direction"

"2 Force Model—Friction 247However, to implement the effect of the friction force f , we need to consider the stateof the block"
 The block may be sliding; still; or transitioning from sliding to still orfrom still to sliding
" If the block is sliding, we use the dynamic friction model"
" If theblock is still, we use the static friction model"
 The force calculation is implementedas follows:x0 = A*sin(omega*t[i])FD = -k*(x[i]-x0)if v[i]==0
"0: # Static frictionf = -FDif abs(f)>mus*N: # Slipsf = -sign(FD)*mud*Nelse: # Dynamic frictionf = -sign(v[i])*mud*NFnet = FD + f#First, we calculate the other forces, F D , acting on the block"
" Then we check if theblock is sticking, which occurs when the velocity is zero"
" In this case, the force willbe the static friction force, Fs , which is equal to the other forces, Fs = −F D , sothat the net force is zero"
" However, this is only true if the static friction force is lessthan the friction threshold"
" If the force exceeds the friction threshold, the block willstart moving in a direction given by the force F D , and the block will experience adynamic force acting in a direction opposite F D and with a magnitude given by thedynamic friction force, f = −sign(F D )μd N "
"Changing the frictional state: Notice that this method checks if the velocity isexactly equal to zero, but this will never occur during a simulation"
 During an inte-gration step the velocity will move from being positive to being negative withoutever being precisely zero
" However, when the velocity of the block changes sign,the block will actually stop and start sticking to the surface with a static frictionforce"
 We therefore set the velocity to be exactly zero when the velocity changessign
" (Alternatively, you could have introduced a state variable, telling if the blockis in a sliding or a sticking state)"
 This check needs to be done during integration:v[i+1] = v[i] + a*dtif (v[i]!=0

3 Circular Motion 2499
"3 Circular MotionHow large forces acts on a roller coaster cart as it passes through a vertical loop, oron a car as it drives through a shape turn on the road? These are questions we cananswer without having a specific model for the forces acting, because the motion isconstrained: A roller coaster cart driving around a loop is constrained to follow theloop, since the cart is attached to the rail"
We have already seen how we can use constraints to find forces for linear motion
"Fortunately, we can use exactly the same technique to determine the forces actingon an object following a curve"
" However, for curved motion we know that the accel-eration also has a component normal to the curve: The centripetal acceleration"
" Forcurved motion we must therefore remember that even though the object follows aparticular path, there must be a net force acting on the object in order for it to followthe path"
"Linear and Curved MotionWe can illustrate the difference between linear and curved motion by looking at abead moving along a wire, as illustrated in Fig"
 9
12
"If the wire is shaped as a line, the bead can be accelerated along the wire but notnormal to the wire"
" Hence, if we analyze the forces acting on the bead and applyNewton’s second law, we recognize that the net force in the x-direction along thewire corresponds to the acceleration along the wire:∑ Fx = ma x "
 (9
55)Fig
 9
"12 Left Illustration of a bead moving along a straight (linear) wire left and a circular (curved)wire (right)250 9 Forces and Constrained MotionBut in the direction normal to the wire (the y-direction), there is no motion and noacceleration"
 Therefore the net force is zero:∑ F y = ma y = 0 
 (9
"56)If the wire is shaped as a circle, the analysis is different"
" Let us describe the motionof the bead using a coordinate system with one axis along the curve, the tangentialaxis, ˆu T ; and one axis normal to the curve pointing in towards the center of thecircle, the normal axis, ˆu N "
" Again, we analyze the forces acting on the bead andapply Newton’s second law"
" The net force in the tangential direction is causing thetangential acceleration:∑ FT = ma T , (9"
"57)But in this case, the motion is not linear"
" Therefore, even though the bead followsthe wire, it is accelerated also in the direction normal to the wire because the wireis curved"
 The net force in the normal direction is therefore related to the centripetalacceleration:∑ F N = ma N = m v2R 
 (9
58)This important difference between linear and curved motion is at the center of ouranalysis of curved constrained motion
Structured Problem-Solving ApproachThe method we apply when analyzing motion along a curved track consists of thefollowing modification to the Model step in the structured problem-solving method:• Find the forces acting on the object
• Introduce models for the forces
• In the normal direction the net force must produce the centripetal acceleration:a N = v2/R• In the tangential direction the tangential acceleration is determined from the nettangential force
You may then Solve to find the motion of the object and Analyze the solution toanswer questions about the motion
Types of ConstraintsWe can classify the constraints into two main types
Non-conditional constraint: The constraint experienced by a bead moving alonga wire
 The bead follows the wire independently of the speed of the motion or anyother property of the motion
 Other similar cases are the motion of a weight attachedto a rigid staff; the motion of a roller coaster car attached to a track; the motion of a9
3 Circular Motion 251person attached to a seat; or the motion of a train along a railway track
 In the casesof a non-conditional constraint we can determine the forces and motion using theapproach presented above
"Conditional constraint: The constraint experienced by a ball swung in a rope: Aslong as the rope is tight, the ball follows a circular path, because the rope pulls on theball when stretched"
 But the rope does not exert any force when pushed
 This meansthat the constraint in conditional: The ball is constrained to follow a circle only aslong as the tensile force needed to make it follow a circle is positive
" If the tensileforce needed is negative, the rope cannot push the ball, and the constraint is no longerpresent"
 In this case the ball is only affected by gravity and air resistance until therope is again tight
" If you want to determine the motion of the ball when the rope isnot tight, you apply Newton’s laws of motion to find the acceleration and solve tofind the position and velocity of the ball using methods you are now proficient in"
Examples of Constrained SystemsA car on a hill-top: Usually we assume that a car driving along a bumpy road followsthe vertical motion of the road
 This is really a constraint on the motion: We assumethat the car follows the path given by the road
" If the car drives along a flat part ofthe road, this gives us a way to estimate the normal force"
" However, the normal forcecan only be positive: The car is not glued to the surface"
 The constraint on the motionof the car is therefore conditional: It can only follow the shape of the surface if thisrequires a positive normal force
" If a negative normal force is required in order tofollow the surface, the car looses contact with the surface"
"A car driving through a curve: Usually, we assume that a car driving around aturn does not slide"
 The car therefore follows a specific track—the track given bythe road
 We can therefore analyze the motion of the car around a turn as if it wasconstrained—following a given curved track
 This requires a net force on the carto give it the necessary centripetal acceleration
 An important component in the netforce is the friction force from the ground on the tires
 But the friction force is limitedby the maximum static friction force
" Hence, the motion of the car is constrained tofollow the curve, but only as long as the friction force is not exceeding its maximum"
9

1 Example: A Car Driving Through a CurveProblem: A car is driving through a circular curve at constant speed
 The coefficientof static friction between the tires of the car and the ground is μs 
 The speed of thecar is v and the radius of the circle is R
" How fast can the car drive before slipping?Approach: This is an example of a conditional constrained problem: The car isconstrained to follow a circular path, but only as long as the static friction forceneeded to give the car the required centripetal acceleration does not exceed themaximum frictional force"

13 a A car driving around a circular track
 b Free-body diagram of the carIdentify: In this problem we address the motion of a car driving through a circularcurve
" We address the motion of the car as it passes the x-axis, as illustrated inFig"
 9
13
 The motion of the car is in the x y-plane
"Model: The car is in contact with the road, giving rise to several contact forces: anormal force in the vertical direction, N , and a frictional force, f , from the groundon the car"
 The friction force has a component f y along the road and a component f xnormal to the road (in the x-direction)
" In addition, the car is affected by the gravity,G = mg in the z-direction"
 The free-body diagram of the car is shown in Fig
 9
13b
We relate the forces acting on the car to its acceleration by applying Newton’ssecond law
" The car is not moving in the vertical (z) direction, hence the accelerationa z is zero:∑ Fz = N − G = N − mg = ma z = 0 , (9"
59)The normal force from the ground on the car is therefore N = mg
"Because the car drives at constant speed, the acceleration in the tangential directionalong the road (the y-direction) is zero:∑ F y = f y = ma y = 0 , (9"
60)Therefore the y-component of the friction force is zero
"Since the car follows a circular path, the car is accelerated in the normal direction,in toward the center of the circle"
 This corresponds to the −x direction in Fig
 9
13
"Since the car is driving with a speed v, the normal acceleration corresponds to thecentripetal acceleration of an object moving in a circle of radius R:∑ Fx = f x = ma x = m(− v2R), (9"
61)9
3 Circular Motion 253The friction force from the road on the car is therefore:f = −m v2R 
 (9
"62)However, we know that the maximum absolute value of the static friction force isfmax = μs N , (9"
63)(Notice that we use the static friction force model here because the car is not slipping)
If the friction force f in (9
"62) required to make the car follow the circular pathexceeds the maximum static friction force, it means that our initial assumption thatthe motion is constrained fails and the car cannot follow a circular path"
 The carstarts sliding at the velocity vm when the static friction force f in (9
62) is equal tothe maximum static friction force:∣∣∣∣−m v2mR∣∣∣∣ = μs N ⇒ v2m = μs g R ⇒ vm = √μs g R 
 (9
64)This means that as long as the friction force is smaller than fmax the car is able tofollow the circular path
" But if the friction force exceeds the static friction force,the car can no longer follow the circular path"
" Instead, it starts sliding and follows anon-circular path, which can also be found from Newton’s second law"
" Sliding startsat a particular speed, vm "
" For speeds below this, the car is able to follow the curve"

2 Example: Pendulum with Air ResistanceIn this example we will address the motion of a pendulum with air resistance
" Thependulum is a classic problem in mechanics, which can be solved analytically, butwith the added complication of air resistance, we need to resort to numerical methods"
Problem: The pendulum consists of a ball of mass m attached to a massless rope oflength L
 The other end of the rope is attached to the ceiling as illustrated in Fig
 9
14
The ball starts at the bottom-most position with an initial velocity v0 
 Find the motionof the pendulum with and without air resistance and discuss the differences
" Whatinitial velocity is needed for the ball to make a complete circle?Approach: First, we will find the motion of the ball, assuming that the ball followsa circular pat, using Newton’s second law"
" We will find the motion without air resis-tance analytically, and use this analytical solution to test a more general numericalmethod"
 The numerical model can be used to find the initial velocity needed to makea complete circle
Identify: Our basic assumption is that the ball is constrained to follow a circularpath
 The position of the ball is measured by the distance s(t) measured along the254 9 Forces and Constrained MotionFig

" Right Free-bodydiagram of the pendulum ballcircle, starting at zero at the bottom of the circle"
" However, we will need to checkthe validity of this constraint to check that the conditions for the ball following thecircular path are satisfied at all times"
" We can also describe s(t) by the angle, θ(t),formed with the vertical as illustrated in Fig"
 9
14
" The arc length, s(t), measuredalong the circle is relate to the angle, θ(t) measured in radians, by s(t) = Lθ(t)"
"Model: The ball is in contact with the rope and the surrounding air, giving rise to theforce from the rope on the ball, the rope tension, T, and the air drag, FD "
" In addition,the ball is subject to the force from gravity, G"
The forces are illustrated in Fig
 9
14 when the ball is at a position s(t) corre-sponding to an angle θ(t)
 We decompose the forces using a local coordinate systemwith unit vectors ˆu T and ˆu N tangential and normal to the path respectively
Trigonometrical decomposition: We may decompose the forces in two ways
 Eitherwe may examine the geometry in Fig
 9
"14 and see that G x = G sin θ and G y =G cos θ, and thereforeG = −mg sin θ ˆu T − mg cos θ ˆu N "
 (9
"65)Unit vector decomposition: Alternatively, we can find ˆu T and ˆu N expressed usingθ, and use these to decompose the vectors using the dot product"
 From Fig
 9
"14 wesee ˆu N , is directed towards the center of the circle, and that the tangential vector isnormal to the normal vector:ˆu N = − sin θ i + cos θ j , ˆu T = cos θ i + sin θ j "
 (9
"66)From these expressions and G = −mg j we findG T = G · ˆu T = −mg sin θ , G N = G · ˆu N = −mg cos θ , (9"
67)just as we found above
" This method is more mathematical, less intuitive, but morerobust—it always works if you are able to write down the unit vectors"

"3 Circular Motion 255Air resistance model: We assume that we may use a quadratic law for the airresistance:FD = −Dv v = −D|v(t)|v(t) ˆu T , (9"
68)where we have used that v = v(t) ˆu T 
 Notice that ˆu T points in the positive rotationaldirection and that v(t) may be positive and negative depending on the direction ofmotion
String tension: The string tension acts in the normal direction: T = T ˆu N 
Newton’s second law: Newton’s second law for the ball gives:∑ F = T + FD + G = m a 
 (9
69)We decompose the acceleration in a tangential and a normal component (fromChap
" 8):a = dvdt ˆu T + v2ρ ˆu N , (9"
70)where ρ = L is the radius of the circle
 The net force on component form is:∑ F = T ˆu N − Dv|v| ˆu T − mg sin θ ˆu T − mg cos θ ˆu N = dvdt ˆu T + v2ρ ˆu N 
 (9
71)The normal component of this equation isT − mg cos θ = m(v2/L)⇒ T = mg cos θ + m(v2/L)
 (9
72)This allows us to calculate T given the velocity v(t) and the angle θ(t)
" The conditionfor circular motion is that T is positive, since the rope can only pull and not pushat the ball"
 If T < 0 our assumptions break down and the ball no longer follows acircular path
"In the tangential direction we get:m dvdt = −Dv|v| − mg sin θ = −Dv|v| − mg sin s(t)L , (9"
73)where we have inserted θ = s(t)/L
" This gives us an equation of motion, just likewe have found before, that we must now solve"
Solve: We want to find the position s(t) as a function of time from (9
73)
" The initialconditions for the ball is that at the time t0 = 0 s the ball is at s(t0) = 0 m, and theinitial velocity is v(t0) = v0 "
256 9 Forces and Constrained MotionAnalytical solution: This problem can be solved when there is no air drag (D = 0)and s(t)  L

76)where we find ω by inserting s(t) from (9
76) into (9
"74), giving ω2 = g/L"
 Thesolution describes a periodic motion with period T = 2π/ω = 2π(L/g)1/2 
"For small deviations and without air resistance, the pendulum will therefore oscil-late back-and-forth with a period given by gravity and the length of the pendulum: Awell know result from mechanics"
 We can use this simplified result to test our moregeneral solution to the problem found below
Numerical solution: The solution for small values of s is not relevant if we want tounderstand how far the ball can be swung
" Instead, we must solve the equation ofmotion numerically"
 The differential equation of motion is:d2sdt2 = − Dm v(t)|v(t)| − g sin s(t)L 
 (9
77)with initial conditions s(0) = 0 and v(0) = v0 
" In addition, we need to check that therope tension remains positive, since our solution breaks down if this is not true"
 UsingT from (9
72) the condition for rope tension is T (t) = mv2/L + mg cos(s/L) ≥ 0
Let us now address a specific pendulum with a ball of mass 0
"5 kg, the rope hasa length of L = 1 m, and the drag coefficient is C D = 0"

" Instead the ball will fall until the rope again becomes tight, andthe ball bounces about in the rope until it comes to rest or starts swinging back andforth"
Results: The result of the simulation is shown in Fig

" The pendulum oscillateswith a relatively small deflection, corresponding to small values of s"
 The dampingdue to air resistance is clearly evident
" However, the damping becomes less dom-inating for smaller velocities, because the damping term depends on square of thevelocity, F D ∝ v2 "
" If we turn air drag off completely, we can compare the numericalsolution to the analytical solution in order to test our numerical model"

16?SummaryLinearly constrained motion:• An object is linearly constrained if it is forced to follow a straight line
"• Choose the T -axis along the motion, and N -axis normal to the motion"
• Decompose forces in the T and N directions
• Set a N = 0
 Use Newton’s second law to find the forces in the N -direction
• Apply Newton’s second law to find acceleration in the T -direction

3 Circular Motion 259Friction force model:• Friction forces are tangential forces at the contact between two objects
• The friction force may depend on the normal forces at the contact
"• If the two objects in contact are not moving relative to each other, the frictionforce f is limited by f m = μs N , where μs is the coefficient of static friction"
"• If the two objects in contact are moving relative to each other, the friction forcef is f = μd N , where μd is the coefficient of dynamic friction"
 The friction forceacts against the relative movement of the objects
Curved motion:• Objects constrained to follow a curved path has an acceleration normal to the pathgiven by the centripetal acceleration a N = v2/R
• The net force in the direction normal to the curve is therefore always non-zerofor curved motion!ExercisesDiscussion Questions9

16 Stick-slip friction
 In this project we will study a phenomenon called stick-slip friction
" If you pull a block along a flat table with a soft spring, you will find thatthe block does not move continuously with a constant velocity, instead it moves insmall jumps"
" This intermittent motion is called stick-slip friction, and it is the originof the high-frequency vibrating tone you often hear from wheels that are not well262 9 Forces and Constrained MotionFig"

5 m/s)
"(m) Can you choose initial conditions r0 and v0 in such a manner that the atommoves in a circular orbit with a constant radius? If so, what initial conditions arethose? Plot the motion for these conditions"
"Chapter 10WorkHow can you find the motion of an atom moving near a surface according to acomplicated position-dependent force without solving Newton’s equation?Up to now, you have learned to use Newton’s laws of motion to determine themotion of an object based on the forces acting on it"
 The methods you have learnedare completely general and can always be applied to solve a problem
" Unfortunately,in many cases we cannot find an exact solution to the equations of motion we getfrom Newton’s second law"
Here we introduce a commonly used technique that allows us to find the velocity asa function of position without finding the position as a function of time—an alternateform of Newton’s second law
" The method is based on a simple principle: Instead ofsolving the equations of motion directly, we integrate the equations of motion"
 Sucha method is called an integration method
 You will learn two integration methods:In this chapter we integrate Newton’s second law in space using the work-energytheorem to find the speed as a function of position; in Chap
 12 we integrate Newton’ssecond law in time to get conservation of momentum
" While these methods are simplefrom a mathematical point of view, they introduce very important physical conceptsthat you will rely on throughout your career"
 You should therefore pay more attentionto the use of these methods than to their derivation
"In this chapter, we introduce the work-energy theorem as a method to find thevelocity as a function of position for an object even in cases when we cannot solve theequations of motion"
 This introduces us to the concept of work and kinetic energy—an energy related to the motion of an object
 Finally we also address the rate of workdone by a force—the power
10
"1 Integration MethodsIn principle, we can determine the motion of any object if we know the net force,Fnet acting on the object, by applying Newton’s second law:m a = Fnet(r, v, t) "

 Since (10
"1) is true,the integral of this equation must also be valid for the motion"
" Integral, you ask, whatintegral? Both the integral over time and the integral over the actual motion—thecurve integral along the motion"
 The following two integrals of (10
"1) also describethe motion: ∫ tt0m a dt =∫ tt0Fnet(r, v, t) dt , (10"
"2)∫Ca · dr =∫CFnet(r, v, t) · dr "
 (10
3)Ok
" This may be true, but it seems entirely unmotivated"
 Why would we want to dothis? Bear with us
 It turns out that both these integrals are very useful and introducepowerful new concepts
" In this chapter, we will focus on the integral in (10"
"3), whilein the next chapter we focus on (10"
2)
"Path IntegralTo understand the motivation, let us look at the integral in (10"
3) in detail and calculatethe left-hand side
 What does the integral in (10
"3) mean? It is the path integral alongthe curve, r(t)"
" However, this integral may depend not only on the path, but also onhow we move along the path—it may depend on the velocity v(t) along the curve"
We should therefore replace the dr with (dr/dt)dt on both sides of the equation
"The equation is still true since it is simply an integral of Newton’s second law:∫ tt0m a · drdt dt =∫ tt0Fnet(r, v, t) · drdt dt "
 (10
"4)Again, you may ask why this is useful"
" The short answer is that it is useful becausewe always can find the analytical solution to the left-hand side and we sometimes canfind the solution to the right-hand side, even if we cannot find the analytical solutionto the acceleration from Newton’s second law"
What is the left-hand side of (10
"4)? It can be solved using integration by parts:∫ tt0m a · drdt dt =∫ tt0m dvdt · v dt = v · v −∫ tt0v · dvdt dt , (10"
5)which gives∫ tt0m a · drdt dt = 12 mv · v 
 (10
6)The left-hand side of (10
"4) therefore only depends on the magnitude of the velocity!We can therefore find the change in velocity, if we only can calculate the integralon the right-hand side of (10"
4)
 The resulting integral equation is called the Work-energy theorem:10
"1 Integration Methods 271Work-energy theorem: For any motion r(t), we can find the change in veloc-ities from the integral W0,1 :W0,1 =∫ t1t0Fnet(r, v, t) · drdt dt = 12 mv21 − 12 mv20 "
 (10
7)Application of the Work-Energy TheoremThe power of the work-energy theorem is best demonstrated by an example
" For anatom moving along a surface, as shown in Fig"
 10
"1, the force from the surface onthe atom can ba approximated as:F(x) = −F0 sin 2π xb , (10"
8)where x is the position of the atom and b is the distance between the atoms on thesurface
" If we apply Newton’s second law to find the motion of the atom, we get∑ Fx = F(x) = −F0 sin 2π xb = ma ⇒ a = − F0m sin 2π xb , (10"
"9)which we can solve numerically, but not analytically"
" However, we can use the Work-energy integral to find the velocity as a function of position for this motion"
 Wecalculate the work integralFig
 10
"1 Illustration of an atom moving along a period lattice of atoms, giving rise to a periodicforce, F(x) = −F0 sin kx272 10 Work∫ tt0F(x(t)) dxdt dt =∫ x(t)x(t0)F(x) dx =∫ xx0−F0 sin 2π xb dx (10"

 (10
"11)If the motion starts from x0 = 0 with v = v0 , we get12 mv2 − 12 mv20 =∫ tt0F(x(t)) dxdt dt = F0b2π(cos 2π xb − 1)"
 (10
"12)and for the velocity, we findv(x) = ±√v20 + F0bmπ(cos 2π xb − 1)"
 (10
13)where the sign depends on what direction the atom is moving in
 This expression is acomplete solution of the motion

We have plotted the analytical solution on top using circles
 Notice the interestingpattern in this figure
 We will spend more time developing our understanding of thismodel further on
10
2 Work-Energy TheoremThe work-energy theorem is an alternative form of Newton’s second law and thereforehas the same range of applicability
" We call the path integral along the curve the workof the net force:W net0,1 =∫ t1t0Fnet(r, v, t) · v dt "
 (10
14)But this definitions seems to require that we know the both r(t) and v(t) in order tosolve the integral
 Hmmmm
" Was not the whole point that we did need to find theanalytical solution?The usefulness of the formulation first comes to its right when the net forcedepends on the position only—that is, when the net force does not depend on thevelocity:W net0,1 =∫ t1t0Fnet(r) · v dt =∫CFnet(r) · dr "
 (10
"15)In this case, we may be able to solve the integral, as we saw above, even if wecannot solve to find the motion"
 This gives the work-energy theorem for a position-10
"2 Work-Energy Theorem 273dependent force:W net0,1 =∫CFnet(r) · dr = 12 mv2 − 12 mv20 "
 (10
"16)This equation has an even simpler form in one dimension when F = Fi and dr = dx,givingW net0,1 =∫ xx0F(x) dx = 12 mv2 − 12 mv20 "
 (10
"17)It is usual to introduce the term kinetic energy, K , for the right-hand side in thework-energy theoremK = 12 mv2 "
 (10
18)This is the reason why we call the theorem the work-energy theorem
" And we cannow formulate it very compactly:W net0,1 = K1 − K0 "
 (10
"19)Where it is usual to drop the subindex 0, 1 for the work"
"Unit of work: The unit for work is Joule (J), which is defined as: 1 J (Joule) =1 Nm = 1 kgm 2/s 2 "
"Comments on the Work-Energy TheoremThe work-energy theorem has several important features:• The work-energy theorem is an alternative formulation of Newton’s second lawof motion, and is therefore valid as long as Newton’s laws are valid"
" For example,it is only valid in an inertial system"
 It is not valid in an accelerated coordinatesystem
• The work-energy is only true if you find the work of the net force
 Do not forgetor leave out any of the forces acting on the object
"• Notice that most microscopic laws of motion, including all interatomic interac-tions, only depend on position"
 The same is true for gravitational forces betweenastronomical objects
 There is a large span of processes where the net force is onlyposition dependent
 The special formulation in (10
17) is therefore a very usefullaw
"For example, if you take a block and pull it back and forth a few times on the floor,you cannot use (10"
"17) to find the work because both the friction force from the flooron the block and the driving force (you pulling or pushing the block) varies not only274 10 Workwith position, but also with time and velocity"
 After pushing the block back and forthyou end up at the same place
 If you used (10
"17), the work would therefore be zero,which is incorrect"
 You have performed work on the block even if the block ends inthe same place it started
Superposition of WorkThe work-energy theorem is only valid for the work done by the net force
" If thereare several forces acting on an object, we may number the forces F j from j = 1 toj = n"
" The net force is the sum of the forces:Fnet = ∑jF j , (10"
20)The work done by the net force can therefore be written as:W net =∫ t1t0Fnet ·v dt =∫ t1t0∑jF j ·v dt = ∑j∫ t1t0F j ·v dt = ∑jW j 
 (10
21)where W j is the work done by force j
 The work done by the net force is thereforethe sum of the work done by each of the forces acting
" For a one-dimensional motionwith a position-dependent force, F = F(x) i this simplifies to:W j =∫ t1t0F j · v dt =∫ xx0F(x) dx "
 (10
"22)The Concept of WorkI am sure you have an intuition of what physical work is, but does that correspond toour definition of mechanical work? Intuitively, it requires work to push a box alongthe floor"
" The longer we push, the more work it requires"
" The heavier the box (andhence the larger the friction force), the more work is done"
" Here, our intuition isconsistent with our definition"
"However, if you lift a box from the floor, it requires work"
 Both in the ordinary useof the word and in our precise definition
" But I am sure you know that just holdinga heavy box in your arms requires effort, although it requires no work according toour definition"
" Trying to push a very heavy box without succeeding also requiresno mechanical work, but still requires effort on your behalf"
" The reasons for thisdiscrepancy are related to how we perceive and experience trying to move something,to how our muscles work inside our bodies, and to how we perceive movement: your10"
2 Work-Energy Theorem 275body may still move somewhat while the box is kept approximately at a constantheight
"However, a mechanical analysis of the work done when you move your body isuseful, and does result in real effects that you can feel"
" It is, for example, possibleto design a backpack that requires less effort to carry long distances based on ourunderstanding of work (and energy conservation)"
"Most importantly, it is important to try to separate the very precise definition ofmechanical work from the looser concept from everyday speech"
10
"3 Work Done by One-Dimensional Force ModelsWe apply the work-energy theorem to various force models, such as a constant force,a spring force, and a given position-dependent force—all in one dimension"
"Work of a Constant ForceThe work done by a constant force, F = F0 , as a car accelerates/decelerates fromx0 to x1 isW =∫ t1t0F0 v dt =∫ x1x0F0 dx = F0 (x1 − x0) = Fx Δx "
 (10
"23)If the force F0 is the only force (or the net force) on the car, the work W correspondsto the change in kinetic energy"
"• Notice that if the force and the displacement, Δx, are in the same direction, thework is positive"
" If this is the net force, it means that the kinetic energy increases,and that the speed increases"
"• If the force and the displacement are in opposite direction, for example if the caris moving in the positive x-direction while it is breaking with a constant force inthe negative x-direction, the work is negative"
" If this is the net force on the car,the kinetic energy decreases and the speed decreases"
Work of a Spring ForceOne of the most commonly used models for a contact force is the spring model
 Whatis the work done by a spring force? Figure 10
2 illustrates the motion of a block on africtionless horizontal surface
 The block is attached to a spring with spring constantk
" The other end of the spring is attached at the origin, x = 0, and the equilibriumlength of the spring is L0 "
" The force, Fx , from the spring on the block is then:276 10 WorkFig"

 (10
"24)The position, x, where the spring force is zero is called the equilibrium position"
"Here, the equilibrium position is x = L0 "
"The work done by the spring force on the block as the block moves from x(t0) = x0to x(t1) = x1 is:W0,1 =∫ t1t0Fx v x dt =∫ x1x0F(x)dx =∫ x1x0−k (x − L0) dx = "
 (10
"25)We change integration variable to u = x − L0 , du = dx, getting:W =∫ x1−L0x0−L0−ku du = 12 k(x0 − L0)2 − 12 k(x1 − L0)2 "
 (10
"26)This result becomes simpler if we move the origin to the equilibrium position of thespring, as shown in Fig"
 10
"2c, so that F(x) = −kx"
 The work from x0 to x1 is thenW = 12 kx21 − 12 kx20

3 Work Done by One-Dimensional Force Models 277Work of a Position-Dependent ForceThe work of a position-dependent force F(x) is found through the integralW =∫ xx0F(x) dx 
 (10
"28)This force F(x) may be a simple function, such as F(x) = −kx or F(x) =F0 sin 2π x/b"
 In that case you can simply solve the integral analytically
" But what ifyou cannot solve the integral analytically or the function F(x) is not know exactly,but instead is measured in a discrete number of points, x i "
" How can you then find thework?Symbolic Integration of a Function F(x)Even if you cannot (or you are too lazy to) solve the integral analytically, you canalways check if Python can the indefinite integral symbolically"
 We demonstrate thisfor a force F(x) = 1/(a + x2) for x > 0
" We integrate this function using thesymbolic package in Python as follows:>> from sympy import *>> a = Symbol(’a’, real=True, positive=True)>> x = Symbol(’x’)>> integrate(1/(a+x**2),x)atan(x/sqrt(a))/sqrt(a)Numerical Integration of a Function F(x)However, if we cannot find an analytical solution to the integral of F(x), we canalways calculate the definite integral numerically"
 The integral from x0 to x1 of F(x)in Fig

" We can calculatethe area by first dividing the interval into smaller pieces, finding an approximate valuefor the area of each such piece, and summing the areas to find total area correspondingto the integral"
We divide the interval from x0 to x1 into n intervals of length Δx = (x1 − x0)/nso that interval i spans from x i to x i+1 = x i + Δ

"Numerical Integration of a Measured F(x i )In some case, the force F(x) may be the result of a more complicated calculationor it may be an experimentally measured value"
" For example, you may calculate thenet force on a basketball bouncing on the floor using an advanced model for thedeformation of the surface of the ball; you may calculate the forces between twoatoms as a function of their position based on an underlying microscopic picturesuch as quantum mechanics; or you may measure the force as a function of positionas you pull on the string of your bow"
" In all these cases you know the force F(x i )for some values x i , but you do not know the general function F(x)"
"How can we estimate the work integral based on a few points? One approachwould be to try to find a smooth function F(x) that goes through all the points, andthen use this function to calculate the work numerically"
" This is a powerful method,but beyond the scope of this text"
" Another method is to apply the trapezoidal ruleon the discrete data as an approximation to the integral, as illustrated in Fig"
 10

"Fortunately, the trapezoidal rule is so robust that we may apply it also in cases whenthe data is not uniformly spaced—that is, when the intervals Δx i = x i+1 − x i vary"
"In this case, we approximate the integral from x0 to x1 by the sum:W0,1 =∫ x1x0F(x) dx n∑i=1Δx i12[F(x i ) + F(x i+1)] "

"You are standing on top of your house and are wondering how to jump downwithout getting hurt: You can jump into a thick snow cover, which exhibits a constantforce, or onto a trampoline, which exhibits a spring force"
 What alternative wouldexert the smallest force?Specify the problem: This problem is formulated loosely on purpose
 You shouldbe able to address such problems by adding the necessary components yourself
 Letus make the problem more specific by adding details and assumptions: You have amass m and your roof is a height h above the ground
 You stop after a distance d
"Also, we neglect air resistance"
10
3 Work Done by One-Dimensional Force Models 281Sketch: The problem addresses the motion of a person falling through air and theninto various materials
 We use y(t) for the vertical position and place the origin atthe top of the cushion with positive direction upward as shown in Fig
 10

"Model: We divide the motion into two phases, as illustrated in Fig"
 10

" Just likewhen we solve problems using Newton’s second law, we start by analyzing the forcesacting on the object"
Phase 1: The person falls through air from y0 = h to y1 = 0
" The only force actingis gravity, G y = −mg"
Phase 2: The person is in contact with the surface from y1 = 0 to y2 = −d
"There is a contact force from the surface, F acting upward in the positivey-direction and gravity, G y = −mg"
Applying the work-energy theorem: We could now use Newton’s second law tofind the position y(t) as a function of time
" We know this would work, but it is a lotof work"
"However, in this case, we do not care about the time it takes for the person to fallfrom the house and then brake during contact with the surface"
" We only care aboutthe velocity immediately before contact with the surface, and the distance he needsto stop while in contact with the surface: We are only interested in questions relatingthe velocity v y to the position y: First, what is the velocity when y = 0? Second,what is the position y when the velocity is zero, that is, when you have stopped?(Ok, this is not really the question"
" We actually want to find the force F necessary toensure that the velocity is zero after a length d into the surface, but this is essentiallythe same as finding the distance d it moves before the velocity is zero when affectedby a force F)"

" Finally, we will relate the stopping distance d to the initialheight h, and then find the maximum force during phase two"
Finding the velocity before impact: In Phase 1 the net force is constant: Fnety =−mg
" We find the change in velocity from y0 to y1 using the work-energy theorem:K1 − K0 = W0,1 , where the work of the net force from y0 to y1 is:W0,1 =∫ t1t0Fnety vdt =∫ y1y0(−mg) dy = −mg (y1 − y0) = mgh , (10"
35)where we have used that y1 = 0 and y0 = h
" This is equal to the change in kineticenergy:W0,1 = mgh = K1 − K0 = 12 mv21 − 12 mv20 = 12 mv21 = K1 "
 (10
"36)where we have used that the person starts from rest, v0 = 0 m/s"
" This gives thatK1 = mgh, which is what we will need to determine the stop length, d"
"Contact with the surface: In Phase 2 the net force is:Fnety = F − mg , (10"
37)where the force F from the surface depends on the nature of the surface
 We willtherefore treat the various surfaces independently
"Falling into snow—Constant force model: For snow, we assume that F is a constantforce"
" We use the work-energy theorem W1,2 = K2 − K1 to relate the stoppingdistance d to the kinetic energy K1 when the contact started"
" The work of the netforce over the distance Δy = y2 − y1 = 0 − d = −d is:W1,2 =∫ y2y1(F − mg) dy = (F − mg) (−d) = K2 − K1 "
 (10
38)where K2 = 0 sice the person stops at y2 
 We insert K1 from (10
"36), getting:− (F − mg) d = −K1 = −mgh ⇒ F − mg = mg hd ⇒ F = mg(1 + hd)"
(10
39)Falling into snow—Discussion: Notice the simplicity of this approach
 We do noteven have to calculate the velocity v1 after the person has fallen a height h
"For a typical house of 6 m height and for a typical person of height 2 m and astopping distance of 1 m, the force from the snow is F = mg (1 + 6) = 7mg"

 From (10

 (10
"43)The force from the trampoline on the person jumping increases with the deformationof the trampoline, and is at its maximum when the trampoline is maximally deformed,which occurs when y = −d"
" The force is then:Fmax = kd = 2d12 kd2 = 2d mg (d + h) , (10"

" Again, we assume that reasonable valuesare h = 6 m and d = 1m, giving:Fmax = kd = 2mg (1 + (6 m/(1 m)) = 14mg , (10"

"Again, the simplicity of the approach is striking"
" We do not have to calculate thevelocity v1 after the person has fallen a height h, we only need to know the kineticenergy at this point in order to carry out the rest of the calculation"

" If we knew howto solve the integral analytically, we might have been able to solve the equation, butin this case we only know how to solve the integral numerically"
 How can we solvesuch an equation and find the d that satisfies (10
"48)?What we need to do, is to calculate the work:W1,2 =∫ x∗0F(x)dx − mgx∗ , (10"
49)as a function of the position x∗ of the jumper
" Our plan is to vary x∗ until we find avalue for x∗ that satisfies the equation, which corresponds to −d"
 We need to vary x∗systematically
" We start from x∗ = 0, where the jumper comes in contact with thecushion, and then gradually decrease x∗ (remember that the jumper is moving downduring the contact with the cushion) until the equation is satisfied, that is, until wefind the value for x∗ for which W1,2 is closest to −mgh"
" More precisely, we makea sequence of x∗ values starting from 0, decreasing in small steps, Δx: x∗0 = 0,x∗1 = x∗0 + Δx, and we calculate the work for each of these numbers until the workis equal to −mgh"
"Can we use any step size Δx in this sequence of x∗i values? If we knew the forceF(x) for any position x, we could calculate the work at any resolution Δx"
 But in thiscase we only know the forces F(x i ) for the values x i where it has been measured
"Therefore, the best possible resolution we can get is to use the measured x i valuesas our sequence of x∗i -values"
 This means that we start by calculating the work forx∗1 = x1 
" Then we calculate the work for x∗2 = x2 , then for x∗3 = y3 and so on, until,for some value i, the work is approximately equal to −mgh"

"9 shows the work W1,2 as a function of the position x calculated usingthis program"
 In the same plot we have also shown the value for −mgh
 We seethat the work starts at zero and decreases gradually as the deformation increasesaand x becomes a large negative number because the work done is negative: The network acts to reduce the kinetic energy
 When the work reaches the value −mghthe jumper stops: the kinetic energy is now zero
" How can we find the x-value thisoccurs at from our numerical data? Based on the plot, we realize that the x valuewhen W1,2 = −mgh can be found as the first value in the sequence of x i ’s forwhich W1,2 < −mgh"
" This value of x will correspond to a work that is slightlysmaller than −mgh, but this is a good first approximation"
 How can we find thisvalue numerically? We use the function find:i2 = min(find(work<mgh))x2 = x(i2)The function find(work<-mgh) returns a list of all the indexes of work thatsatisfies the condition work<-mgh
" We need to find the first of the indexes in thissequence, therefore we take the minimum index in this list, and find the correspondingy-value"

10 illustrates a general three-dimensional motion from 0 to 1
" For thismotion, the net work isW =∫ t1t0Fnet · v dt = K1 − K0 "
 (10
"51)Because v points in the tangential direction, we notice that it is only the tangentialcomponent of the force that does any work! We can demonstrate this by introducinga local coordinate system along the path of motion, with unit vectors ˆu T in thetangential direction and ˆu N in the normal direction"
 The velocity vector points alongthe tangential unit vector:v = v ˆu T (t) 
 (10
"52)If we decompose a force, F j , in the tangential and normal directions along the pathof motion:F j = F j,T (t) ˆu T (t) + F j,N (t) ˆu N (t) , (10"
53)we see that the work done by the force F j is:W j =∫ t1t0F j · drdt dt (10

 (10
"57)where we have used that the normal unit vector, ˆu N , is normal to the velocity vector,v"
" Consequently, it is only the tangential component of the force that contributes tothe work"
"This is also intuitive, since we know that normal forces only contribute to a changein the direction of the velocity vector and not to a change in the speed—it is onlythe tangential force that can cause a tangential acceleration which causes a changein speed"
Work of a Constant Force in Two and Three DimensionsThe work done by a constant force has a particularly simple solution
 Let us addressthe work done on an object by a constant force F as the object is moved from r(t0)to r(t1) as illustrated in Fig
 10
11
" The work done on the object isW F =∫ t1t0F · vdt =∫ 10F · dr , (10"
"58)Since the force is constant, we move it outside the integration:W F = F ·∫ 10dr︸ ︷︷ ︸=(r(t1)−r(t0))= F · (r(t1) − r(t0)) "
 (10
59)We call s = Δr = r(t1) − r(t0) the displacement
 The work of a constant force istherefore:W = F · Δr

" This is a very nice propertyof a force, since it makes it convenient to calculate the work done"
" A force withthis property is called a conservative force, and we will see that such forces play aprominent role in our studies of mechanical energy"

 Find the speed of the projectile at the height y1 
 You can neglect airresistance
"Identify: In this problem we address the motion of the projectile, described by theposition r(t)"
" The projectile is at y0 at t0 with a velocity v0 , and at a height h1 at t1with a speed v1 "
"Model: The projectile is only affected by gravity, which is constant, G = −mg j"
Solve: We can therefore use the work-energy theorem to find the kinetic energy ofthe projectile:W =∫ t1t0G · v dt =∫ 10G · dr = K1 − K0 
 (10
"61)Since the force is constant, the work only depends on the displacement:W = G · s = (−mg j) · (Δx i + Δy j) = −mgΔy "
 (10
62)The motion in the x-direction has no impact on the work
" It is only the displacementin the y-direction that contributes to a change in kinetic energy:K1 − K0 = 12 mv21 − 12 mv20 = −mgΔy , (10"
"63)The speed v1 is therefore:v21 = v20 − 2g (y1 − y0) , (10"
64)The right-hand side must be positive for this equation to have a meaningful solution

2 Example: Roller-Coaster MotionProblem: A roller-coaster cart is rolling from the height h to the height 0 along acurving roller-coaster track
 It starts with the speed v0 at the top of the track
 Find292 10 WorkFig
 10
12 A roller-coastercart moving along aroller-coaster trackthe speed v1 of the roller-coaster cart at the bottom of the track
 You can ignore airresistance and friction
"Identify: The cart follows the path r(t) from r(t0) = h j at t = t0 to r(t1) = 0 j att = t1 , as illustrated in Fig"
 10
12
"Model: The cart is affected by the normal force, N, the friction force, f, and gravity,G = −mg j"
" We assume that friction is negligible, f = 0 throughout the motion"
 Thenormal force N varies throughout the motion
 It is therefore not that simple to applyNewton’s second law directly to determine the motion of the cart
" However, becausethe normal force always is normal to the path of motion, it performs no work"
 Wecan therefore apply the work-energy theorem to determine the velocity of the cart atthe end of the track
Solve: The work energy-theorem relates the work of the net force to the change inkinetic energy:Wnet = ΔK = K1 − K0 = 12 mv21 − 12 mv20 
 (10
"65)We can therefore find the speed, v1 , if we know the net work:Wnet =∫ t1t0Fnet · v dt =∫ t1t0(N + G) · v dt =∫ t1t0N · v︸︷︷︸=0dt +∫ t1t0G · v dt = W G(10"
"66)As we argued above, the normal force does no work"
 The work done by gravity isthe same as we have found previously:W G =∫ 10G · dr = G ·∫ 10dr = G · (r(t1) − r(t0)) 
 (10
"67)Since G = −mg j, only the vertical component of the displacement is included inthe work:W G = −mgj · (r(t1) − r(t0)) = −mg(y1 − y0) = −mg(0 − h) = mgh "

4 Work Done in Two- and Three-Dimensional Motions 293We use this result in the work-energy theorem to find v1 :12 mv21 − 12 mv20 = mgh ⇒ v21 = v20 + 2gh 
 (10
"69)Analyze: We have learned that for motion with a normal force, the normal forcedoes no work and we can therefore use the same analysis as for an object falling dueto gravity"
" However, this is only true as long as there are no additional forces thatdepend on the normal force, such as a friction force, or a force that depends on forexample the velocity of the cart, such as the air resistance"
" In these cases, we needto make a more detailed analysis"

3 Example: Work on a Block Sliding Down a PlaneProblem: A classical problem in mechanics is the motion of a block sliding downan inclined plane
" If the block starts from rest, what is the velocity of the block whenit has moved a vertical distance h? The plane forms an angle α with the horizontal,the mass of the block is m, the acceleration of gravity is g, and μ is the dynamiccoefficient of friction between the block and the plane"
"Approach: We use the work-energy theorem to find the change in velocity from thechange in kinetic energy, which only depends on the vertical displacement"
"Identify: We use r(t) to describe the motion of the block from r(t0) at t = t0 to r(t1)at t = t1 , as illustrated in Fig"
 10
13
"Model: The block is affected by the normal force from the plane, N, the frictionforce, f, and gravity, G = −mg j"
" Since the block is sliding relative to the surface,the we use a dynamic friction model:hv0 =0GfNh v1 =?uTLααuNFig"
 10
13 A block sliding down along an inclined plane294 10 Workf = −μ N vv 
 (10
70)where the normal force must be determined from the motion in the direction normalto the plane
" Since we assume that there is no motion normal to the plane, Newton’ssecond law gives:∑ F N = N + G N = ma N = 0 ⇒ N = −G N "
 (10
"71)where G N is the component of gravity in the normal direction, given by the unitvector, ˆu N "
 From Fig
 10
13 we see that:ˆu N = sin α i + cos α j 
 (10
"72)We find G N by projecting G on ˆu N :G N = G · ˆu N = −mg j · (sin α i + cos α j) = −mg cos α , (10"
73)which inserted in (10
71) gives: N = mg cos α
"Solve: The work-energy theorem for the motion of the block relates the work doneby the net force on the block to the change in kinetic energy, Wnet = K1 − K0 , whereWnet = ∑jW j = W N + W f + W G "
 (10
"74)The work done by the normal force is zero, since it is always normal to the directionof motion: W N = 0"
" Since gravity is a constant, the work done by gravity onlydepends on the displacement, Δr:W G = G · Δr = −mg (y0 − y1) = mgh "
 (10
"75)In this particular case, we can find the work done by friction, because the frictionforce is constant during the motion:W f =∫ t1t0f · v dt = f · Δr "
 (10
76)where both f and Δr are directed along the slope
" The work done by friction isthereforeW f = − f s , (10"
77)10
4 Work Done in Two- and Three-Dimensional Motions 295where s is the distance along the slope
" For a slope with an inclination α, the distances is related to the height h by:hs = sin α ⇒ s = hsin α "
 (10
78)This gives:W f = − f s = −μ N hsin α = −μ mg h cos αsin α 
 (10
"79)We apply the work-energy theory to find the kinetic energy and the speed at the endof the slope:Wnet = W N + W f + W G = mgh − μmgh cot α = K1 − K0 = 12 mv21 , (10"
80)where we have used that K0 = 0
 This givesv21 = 2gh (1 − μ cot α)

5 PowerYou are pulling a crate along the floor with a force F
" In a small time interval Δtyou have pulled the crate from the position r(t) to r(t + Δt), and the force F hasperformed the workΔW =∫ t+ΔttF · v dt "
 (10
"82)For a small time interval we can assume that the force F is constant, hence:ΔW = F ·∫ t+Δttv dt = F · (r(t + Δt) − r(t)) = F · Δr "
 (10
83)We divide by Δt on each side and find that:ΔWΔt = F · ΔrΔt (10
"84)and in the limit when Δt → 0 we have the definition of296 10 WorkPower: Power is the amount of work performed per unit time, that is, the rateat which we perform work:P = limΔt→0ΔWΔt = F · v "
 (10
"85)The unit of power is Watt (W), which is defined as:1 W = 1 J/s = 1 Nm/s "

 The metric horsepower is defined as:1 hP = 735

"1 Example: Power Exerted When Climbing the StairsProblem: You are climbing the stairs, moving upward at a constant vertical velocityv0 "
" What is the power exerted?Solution: Since you are moving upward with a constant velocity, v0 , your accelerationupward is zero"
" Therefore, there is no net force in the vertical direction"
" The normalforce N exerted from the ground on you therefore equals the gravitational force,W = mg, if we assume that other forces, such as air resistance, are negligible"
 Therate at which the normal force does work on you—the power of the normal force—is:P = N v0 = mgv0

2 Example: Power of Small BacteriumProblem: A small bacterium with approximately spherical shape is moving with aconstant velocity v through water
 Find the power exerted by the bacterium
Model: The motion of the bacterium is determined by the forces acting on thebacterium
" The bacterium is affected by two main forces: The fluid drag force, D,and the propulsion force, F, which is a force from the fluid on the bacterium due tothe swirling motion of the bacterium’s tail"
"From Newton’s second law we see that:F + D = ma = 0 , (10"
89)10
5 Power 297where a = 0 since the bacterium is moving with constant velocity
" Consequently,F = −D "
 (10
90)We have a good force model for the fluid drag
" Because the bacterium is small andis moving at a tiny velocity, the fluid drag force is well approximated by the viscousforce model:D = −k vv "
 (10
91)The power exerted by the bacterium corresponds to the power exerted by the force F:P = F · v = k vv · v = k v v2 
 (10
92)SummaryWork: The work done on an object by the force F moving the object along the pathr(t) is:W =∫ t1t0F · vdt 
We can write this as a line integral along the path C given by r(t):W =∫ 10F · dr 
Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy of an object is defined as:K = 12 mv · v = 12 mv2 
Work-energy theorem: The work done by the net force on an object along the pathfrom 0 to 1 corresponds to the change in kinetic energy of the object:Wnet =∫ t1t0Fnet · vdt = K1 − K0Work of a constant force: The work of a constant force is W = F · s
"Work of a position-dependent force in one dimension: If a force only depends onthe position, Fx = Fx (x), the work is an integral over x only:W F =∫ x1x0Fx (x)dx "
298 10 WorkIt is often easier to solve the work integral for a complicated position-dependent forcethan to find the motion of the object
 The work-energy theorem is therefore a usefultool to relate the velocity and position of an object without finding the completemotion x(t)
Power: The power P exerted by a force F is the rate of work done by the force:P = F · vExercisesDiscussion Questions10

Comment on your results
"(j) Based on your results, can you make recommendations for how to design cars forcity traffic and for long distance travel?Chapter 11EnergyYou have now learned to use the work-energy theorem as an alternative formulationof Newton’s second law—as a “calculation” tool to determine the motion of an object"
"Using Newton’s second law, we find the motion of an object described as the positionas a function of time"
" The work-energy theorem allows us to find the velocity as afunction of position without determining the whole motion, and we have learnedthat this may be useful, in particular when we are unable to find an exact solution tothe equations of motion"
" While this was a practical application of the work-energytheorem, the real strength of the work-energy theorem is a conceptual change: Wego from discussing motion and processes in terms of forces to instead discuss themin terms of energy and energy conservation"
Conservation laws: One of the most important consequences of Newton’s secondlaw and its alternative formulation through the work-energy theorem is the concept ofa conservation law: That there are quantities in a system that are conserved throughouta process
 We observe the system and record a particular quantity
" Then we let thesystem develop in time, and we measure the same quantity again"
" If the quantity isconserved, it means that the quantity is unchanged, no matter what happens insidethe system"
The two most important conservation laws you will learn are the conservationof (mechanical) energy and the conservation of momentum
" The conservation lawsin mechanics are consequences of Newton’s laws of motion, but the conservationlaw for energy is much more general than that—it is one of the most general lawswe know in nature"
" Throughout your studies of physics you will gradually learn tomake energy considerations and energy conservation an integral part of your thoughtprocess, starting from this chapter"
In practice the conservation laws represent clever ways to solve physics problems
"In many cases we cannot solve the equations of motion we get from Newton’s secondlaw directly, but in some cases we can solve the equations we get when we integrateNewton’s second law"
 The conservation law for momentum comes from integratingNewton’s second law in time and the conservation law for energy comes from in-© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015A

"Overview: In this chapter, we introduce the concept of energy and energy conserva-tion through two examples: A vertical bowshot and an atom moving along a surface"
"Based on the examples, we introduce the concept of potential energy for a position-dependent force, a positional energy, to complement the kinetic energy, an energy ofmotion"
" For objects subject only to position-dependent force, the sum of the potentialand kinetic energy is constant"
 We can therefore interpret a motion as a transfer ofenergy between kinetic and potential energies
"We show how to calculate the potential energy for a constant force, a springforce, and a general position-dependent force, and how to use energy conservation tosolve mechanics problems"
 We introduce the energy diagram as an alternative way toanalyze and understand motion
 We generalize the concept of potential energy to two-and three-dimensional motion
" Finally, we introduce the general energy principle,the second law of thermodynamics, and relate external work to changes in the totalenergy of a system"
11
1 Motivating ExamplesThe work-energy theorem provides us with an alternative formulation of Newton’ssecond law that is particularly suited to find the velocity as a function of position inthe case when only position-dependent forces act on an object
" But we can simplifythe analysis even further by the introduction of a position-dependent energy to com-plement the velocity-dependent kinetic energy, allowing us to use the conservationof total energy as an every quicker way to resolve questions relating the velocity andthe position of an object subject only to position-dependent forces"
 We demonstratethis method by addressing a vertical bowshot and motion along a surface
"Work-Energy as a Conservation LawHow can the work-energy integral be considered a conservation law? And what dowe mean by conservation? We know that any motion must satisfy Newton’s secondlaw and its path integral, the work-energy theorem"
" Let us see how this behaves ina simplified case—for a one dimensional motion with a net force that only dependson the position, Fnet = F(x)"
" The work-energy integral is thenW0,1 =∫ t1t0F(x(t))v(t) dt =∫ x1x0F(x) dx = φ(x1)−φ(x0) = K1 − K0 , (11"
"1)where we have introduced the function φ(x), which is the indefinite integral of F(x),so that d F/dx = φ(x)"
 This equation is valid for any two points x0 and x1 along the11
1 Motivating Examples 305motion
" We can rearrange this equation, so that all the quantities related to position0 is on the left hand side and all the quantities related to position 1 is on the righthand side:K0 − φ(x0) = K1 − φ(x1) "
 (11
"2)The function, K −φ(x) is a constant along the motion—it is conserved for the motion"
"We have found an example of a conservation law! Let us examine this conservationlaw in two simple examples to gain more intuition:Vertical ShotIf you shoot an arrow vertically upwards, and we neglect air resistance, the arrow isaffected by gravity, G = −mg, alone"
 This is a one-dimensional motion with a netforce that only depends on position
 (The force is constant and does therefore notdepend on anything else than the position)
" If the arrow starts from y = y0 with avelocity v0 , we can apply the work-energy theorem to find the kinetic energy, K1 , atany other position, y1 "
" And from the kinetic energy we can find the velocity, v1 , if sowe please"
" The work-energy theorem gives:W0,1 =∫ t1t0Gv y dt =∫ y1y0−mg dy = mgy0 − mgy1 = K1 − K0 , (11"
"3)Let us rearrange this equation so that everything that refers to position 0 is on theleft hand side, and everything that relates to position 1 is on the right hand side:mgy0 + K0 = mgy1 + K1 "
 (11
"4)What does this mean? The left hand side is a constant that depends on the initialposition, y0 , and the initial velocity, v0 , of the arrow"
 But the position y1 on the righthand side can be any position along the motion: This means that the sum mgy + Kis constant throughout the motion
" How can we interpret the various terms? Wehave already introduced the notion “kinetic energy” for the velocity-dependent term,K = (1/2)mv2 "
" The mgy term must therefore also have units of energy, and we caninterpret this as an energy too"
" However, this energy does not depend on the velocityof the arrow, but on its position"
" We call this a positional energy, or more commonly,it is called a potential energy, U = mgy"
 We see that U is related to the function φwe defined in (11
1)
" We can now write the work-energy theorem for the motion as:U0 + K0 = U1 + K1 = E , (11"

"As the arrow moves upward, the kinetic energy reduces and the potential energyincreases until the arrow reaches its maximum height, where the kinetic energy iszero and the potential energy is at its maximum, corresponding to the initial kineticenergy of the arrow"
" The kinetic energy cannot be negative, and therefore the arrowcannot go higher than this"
" As the arrow falls down again, the kinetic energy increasesas the potential energy is reduced"
" The whole process is often illustrated by the barchart diagram, which indicates that the total energy is conserved"
 It is only how theenergy is distributed between the kinetic and potential energies that varies throughoutthe motion

 There is a simple solution to this: We can add a constant to both sides in(11
10)—and we can add a constant to the function U (x) since we only care thatits derivative dU/dx = −F(x) and the derivative of a constant will be zero
 Thismeans that you are free to determine the zero level of the potential energy
" Here, wewould like the potential energy to be zero for the initial state, where x = x0 , whichwe achieve with the potential energy:U ′1 = U1 + U ∗ = U ∗(1 − cos 2π xb)"
 (11
11)This is nice and positive for all values of x1 and it is zero at x = 0
 Good
" Let us usethis expression for the potential energy, giving the conservation law:U ′(x) + K = U ∗(1 − cos 2π xb)+ K = const"
 
 (11
12)This conservation law gives useful insight into the motion illustrated in Fig

"The plots show the position x(t) of the atom for a small initial velocity v0 , andcorresponding plots of the kinetic, K (t), and potential, U ′(t), energies"
" The atomstart with an initial kinetic energy, but no potential energy (we designed the potentialenergy this way, remember)"
" As it starts moving in the positive x-direction, thepotential energy increases, and the kinetic energy decreases, and the atom slowsdown"
" Until, at a particular value of x, x = x a , the kinetic energy becomes zero"
" Sincethe kinetic energy cannot become less than zero, the atom cannot progress further inthe positive x-direction"
 All the initial kinetic energy is now potential energy
" Theatom then starts moving in the negative x-direction, increasing its kinetic energy (andtherefore speed) until it reaches x = 0"
 Then the kinetic energy decreases again until308 11 EnergyFig

 Throughout this oscillation back and forththe total energy is distributed between kinetic and potential energy in such a way thatthe total remains a constant
"What happens if we start the atom from the same position, x0 , but with a largerinitial velocity, v0 ? Fig"
 11
"3 illustrates the motion, x(t), and energies for a largeinitial velocity, v0 "
" Since the initial velocity is larger, the total energy, correspondingto the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, E = K + U ′, is also larger thanin Fig"

"Also in this case, we see that as the atom starts to move in the positive x-direction,the potential energy increases and the kinetic energy decreases"
" However, in this11"
"1 Motivating Examples 309case, the kinetic energy never goes to zero"
 The atom therefore continues to moveindefinitely in the positive x-direction
" The velocity is therefore always positive, butit varies in magnitude according to the potential energy"
" You may wonder at whatinitial velocity v0 the atom starts to be “free”—when does the kinetic energy notbecome zero? For now, we leave that for you to figure out, but we will revisit thissituation later in the chapter"
These examples introduces the concepts of potential energy and energy conser-vation
" In the rest of the chapter we will put these concepts in a more formal setting,and see many examples of the power of their use"
11
"2 Potential Energy in One DimensionThrough these examples we have introduced the concept of potential energy, definedthrough the work-energy theorem"
" For a one-dimensional motion where the objectis subject to a single force F(x), which only depends on the position and not onthe velocity or the time, we can introduce a potential energy for the force and aconservation law for the motion"
" The work-energy theorem for a motion from x0 tox1 givesW0,1 =∫ t1t0F(x(t)) dxdt dt =∫ x1x0F(x) dx = K1 − K0 , (11"
"13)We can now introduce the function U (x), which we call the potential energy, so thatthe work integral becomesW0,1 =∫ x1x0F(x) dx = U (x0) − U (x1) = U0 − U1 "
 (11
"14)Notice the choice of signs in this equation, introduced this way so that we could“pair” the energies at 0 and 1:U0 + K0 = U1 + K1 , (11"
"15)In the examples above we found that for gravity:U (x) = mgx , (11"
16)and for atomic motion along a surfaceU (x) = U ∗(1 − cos 2π xb)
 (11
17)310 11 EnergyWe can find the potential energy at any x by calculating the integral of −F(x)from some point x∗:U (x) = U (x∗) +∫ xx∗−F(x) dx 
 (11
18)Hmmm
 What is the value of U (x∗)? We do not know
" Actually, we are free tochoose any value we like for U (x∗), because the change in velocity from x0 to x1only depends on the difference between the potential energy at U (x0) and U (x1)"
"This may seem confusing at first—that the potential energy is not given as a particularnumber, but rather as a function with an undetermined zero level"
 But you may havesome experience with this already based on your knowledge of calculus
 If you look at(11
"18) you may recognize that this defines the potential enegy U (x) as the indefiniteintegral of F(x):U (x) =∫−F(x) + C , (11"
"19)that is, the function U (x) is the anti-derivative of F(x)"
" We could put this the otherway, the definition of the potential energy U (x) in (11"
18) implies that −F(x) is thederivative of U (x):Fx (x) = − dUdx 
 (11
20)We see that whatever constant we add to U (x) does not affect the force we get fromtaking the derivative
Conservation of EnergyThese relations define the potential energy U (x) and relate it to the force F(x) on theobject
" Notice that these definitions are general, and are valid also in cases where wecannot find a closed expression for the integral of F(x)"
 We have therefore shown that(11
"20) is general, showing that for an object subject to a single, position-dependentforce, F(x), the total energy is conserved throughout the motion:E0 = U (x0) + K0 = U (x1) + K1 = E1 "
 (11
21)We say that the mechanical energy of the object is conserved
"We call the corresponding force F(x) a conservative force, if the mechanicalenergy is conserved"
" The mechanical energy is conserved if there exists a potentialU (x) for the force F(x), or, to formulate it in an alternative way: If the work doneby the force only depends on the end-points of the motion"
 Both statements may beused as equivalent definitions of a conservative force:11
2 Potential Energy in One Dimension 311The work done by a conservative force only depends on the end-points of themotion and not on the path taken
A force F(x) is conservative if and only if it can be written as the derivativeof the potential U (x):Fx (x) = − dUdx 
 (11
22)We call U (x) the potential for F(x) or the potential energy of the object
"In one dimension, a force F(x) that only depends on the position x (and not onthe velocity or time) is conservative, since we can always find a potential U (x), asdemonstrated above"
" But in two- and three-dimension, a force that depends only onthe position is generally not conservative"
 A conservative force needs to fulfil anadditional condition that we return to later
"Potential Energy for a Constant ForceAn object moves from x A to x B while subject to a constant net force, F0 , in thex-direction"
 What is the potential energy for the object?We find the potential energy from the integral in (11
"18), starting from x = x0 :U (x) = U (x0) +∫ xx0−F0 dx = U (x0) − F0 (x − x0) , (11"
23)where we are free to choose the value for U (x0)
" For example, we may chooseU (x0) = −F0 x0 , which gives:U (x) = −F0 x "
 (11
"24)We recognize this from our previous calculation of the potential energy for the verticalbowshot, where the arrow is only subject to a (constant) gravity, G = F0 = −mg,and therefore:U (x) = −F0 x = − (−mg) x = mgx "
 (11
25)Energy conservation for an object subject to a constant force can therefore be ex-pressed as:312 11 EnergyE0 = U0 + K0 = U1 + K1 = E1 (11
"26)E0 = −F0 x0 + 12 mv20 = −F0 x1 + 12 mv21 = E1 , (11"
"27)and for motion in the gravity field, we recover the well-know result:mgx0 + 12 mv20 = mgx1 + 12 mv21 "
 (11
28)Potential Energy in the Gravity Field with Normal ForcesThe conservation of mechanical energy for motion subject only to gravitational forcesis a useful tool to find simple solutions and make quick judgements about motions
"However, the method is even more versatile"
" We can also use it when an object issubject to gravity and a normal force, because the normal force does no work on theobject during the motion"
"Let us demonstrate the use of potential energy methods for motion under gravityand normal forces by studying the motion of a bead moving along a friction-freewire shaped as a helix, as illustrated in Fig"
 11
4
" The forces acting on the bead aregravity, G = −mg j, and a normal force, N, from the wire on the bead"
"We apply the net work-energy theorem for motion from position 0 at a height y0 ,to a point P at a height y"
 The work done on the bead by the net force Fnet = G + Nis then:W net =∫ P0Fnet︸︷︷︸=G+N·dr =∫ P0(G + N) · dr =∫ P0G · dr +∫ P0N · dr= G ·∫ P0dr +∫ tt0N · v︸︷︷︸=0dt = −mg(y − y0) + 0 (11

"30)which shows that mechanical energy is conserved for motion under gravity with anormal force, which is what we expected since the normal force does no work duringthe motion"
 The shape of the path does not matter: The energies depend only on thevertical position of the bead
Potential Energy for a Spring ForceWe have already discussed the potential for a constant force
 The next step is tostudy the simlest possible (one dimensional) force that depends on position alone:the spring force
 What is the potential energy of an object subject to a spring forceF(x)?Figure 11
"5 illustrates a spring block system, where a block of mass m lies on africtionless table"
" The block is attached to a spring with spring constant k, and theequilibrium position of the block-spring system is b"
" The force F on the block fromthe spring is modelled using a spring force model: F(x) = −k(x − b), where x isthe position of the block"
"The force F depends on the position of the block only: It does not depend on thevelocity of the block, and it does not depend directly on time"
 We can therefore findthe potential energy by integrating the force F(x) using the definition in (11
18):U (x) − U (x0) =∫ x1x0−F(x) dx =∫ x1x0k(x − b) dx = 12 kx21 − 12 kx20 
 (11
"31)We are free to choose U (x0), so we may choose U (x0) so that U (x) is zero whenthe spring is in its equilibrium position"
" That is, we want U (b) = 0:U (b) = U (x0) + 12 kb2 − 12 kx20 = 0 ⇒ U (x0) = 12 kx20 "
 (11
32)The potential energy for a spring force F(x) = −k(x − b) is therefore:U (x) = 12 k(x − b)2 
 (11

" , isFnet = ∑jF j (x) "
 (11
"34)Let us assume that each of the forces F j (x) are conservative, that is, they dependon the position x only (and not on velocity or time)"
 The potential energy for forceF j (x) is U j (x)
" The work-energy theorem for a motion from x0 to x1 gives:W net0,1 =∫ x1x0Fnetdx =∫ x1x0∑jF j (x)dx = ∑j∫ x1x0F j (x)dx= ∑j(U j (x0) − U j (x1)) = K1 − K0 "
 (11
35)We move all the terms relating to position 0 to the right-hand side of the equation:∑jU j (x1)︸ ︷︷ ︸U (x1)+K1 = ∑jU j (x0)︸ ︷︷ ︸U (x0)+K0 
 (11
36)where the potential energy U (x) is the sum of the potential energies for each of theforces F j (x)
 This gives a general law for energy conservation:U (x1) + K1 = U (x0) + K0 
 (11
37)We can therefore generalize the energy conservation methods introduced above byintroducing a potential energy for each of the forces affecting the object
" Energyconservation still holds, as long as we include the sum of all the potential energiesfor all the forces affecting the object"

 Wealready know that for motion under gravity we can use energy considerations to relateposition and velocity
 What about the tension T? It is always normal to the directionof motion of the sphere
" The rope tension T is a normal force, which does no workduring the motion"
 We can therefore use energy conservation to solve the problem
"We examine two positions, as illustrated in Fig"

"8, and use energy conservationto relate the two positions"
 In position 0 the sphere is at the top of its path
 This iswhere the motion changes direction
 The velocity is zero at this position

"4 Example: Spring CannonThis problem is a classic in mechanicsProblem: A block of mass m is placed on top of a vertical, massless spring withspring constant k"
 The spring is contracted a distance Δy from its equilibrium position(when there is no block on top of it)
" The spring is released, and the block is shotup through the air"
 How high up does the block go? You may neglect friction and airresistance
"Identify: The motion of the block is one dimensional, and we characterize the po-sition of the block by its vertical position y"
 The block starts at a vertical positiony0 at the time t0 with no vertical velocity v0 = 0
 The block is in contact with thespring until the time t1 when the vertical position is y1 
" From there on, the block ismoving through the air without being in contact with the spring"
" The block reachesits maximum height y2 at the time t2 , and the velocity of the block at this point isv2 = 0"
 The process is illustrated in Fig
 11

"Model: The block is affected by two forces: The spring force F and the force fromgravity, G = −mg j"
 Both gravity and the spring force are conservative forces
 Wecan therefore apply energy conservation to relate the position and velocity of theblock
" However, the spring force is only acting when y < y1 "
Solve: We use conservation of mechanical energy to solve this problem
 Energyis conserved because all forces only depend on the position of the block
 They donot depend on the velocity of the block or directly on time
 Mechanical energy istherefore conserved throughout the motion

" If we instead opted to use Newton’s laws of motion, thecalculations would be significantly longer"
" But remember that we can only use en-ergy considerations when all the forces are conservative: If there was friction, airresistance, or other velocity-dependent force, we could not have used energy consid-erations directly, and in most cases, we would need to determine the motion in orderto determine the work done by the velocity-dependent forces, and we would need tosolve for the motion anyway"
Comment: Notice how we chose the potential energy for the spring-block interac-tion
" We do not need to choose the potetial energy U F (y) to be zero at y1 , we couldfor example also have chosen it to be:U F (y) = 12 k(y − y1)2 + C (11"
60)where C is a constant
" However, in this case, we need to ensure that we include thisconstant both in the energy at position y1 and at the position y2 "
" Why also at positiony2 —there is no spring force acting here? It is correct that we are free to choose theconstant C, but we are not free to change this choice between the various phases"
" Ifwe have chosen a particular C, we must ensure that our choise is consistent whenwe go from y1 to y2 "

" We illustrate the1 If we assume that the cart has no height, that is, that the cart is only a point mass moving along thesurface"
322 11 Energytotal energy by drawing a horizontal line in the potential energy plot
" From the figurewe can now read off both the total energy, this is the horizontal line, and the potentialenergy as a function of position—this is the curve that looks like the terrain"
"Interpreting kinetic energy: How can we use this figure to understand the motion?At the point 1, the potential energy is smaller than the total energy:E1 = U1 + K1 = E0 , (11"
"64)This means that the amount of energy above the potential energy curve is the kineticenergy, illustrated by the blue line in the figure"
 We can therefore read both thepotential energy and the kinetic energy directly from the figure: The kinetic energyis the distance from the potential energy curve up to the horizontal line that givesthe total energy
 We call this diagram an energy diagram
 The energy diagram is auseful tool for discussing the motion of an object
"Limits of possible motion: The kinetic energy is zero where the horizontal lineintersects the potential energy curve (for E = E0 at points x0 , x2 , and x3 "
) Thecart cannot cross this line
" At this point the speed is zero, and the cart changesdirection"
 We can therefore use the energy diagram to determine the limits of thepossible motion
" The cart cannot have negative kinetic energy—for a given totalenergy, this limits the possible positions of the cart"
" Consequently, when the totalenergy is E = E0 , the cart cannot reach the regions indicanted by the dashed line"
"Notice that for a given total energy, the cart can be locked into separate domains"
"If the cart starts at position 0 with zero kinetic energy, it will never reach point 3"
"Similarly, if the cart starts at point 3 with zero kinetic energy, it cannot reach point 0"
"However, if we increase the total energy, for example by increasing the speed ofthe cart, to the value E∗ on the figure, the cart can move all over the terrain"
Equilibrium points: How do we interpret a flat part of the terrain? A flat part of theterrain corresponds to a flat part of the potential energy curve
" At a flat part, there areno horizontal forces"
 A flat part is therefore an equilibrium point
" If the cart starts atrest at an equilibrium point, it will not start moving, because there are no horizontalforces"
Stable and unstable equilibrium points: The top of a hill and the bottom of avalley are also flat points
 There are no horizontal forces acting on the cart at thesepoints
 But there is a difference between the hilltop and the valleybottom
 If you startfrom the hilltop (e
g
" at x4 ), and give the cart a tiny push, it accelerates away fromthe hilltop"
 We therefore call such a point an unstable equilibrium point
" However,if you start at the bottom of a valley (e"
g
" at x5 ), and give the cart a tiny push, thecart accelerates back towards the equilibrium point—we therefore call such a pointa stable equilibrium point"
"Limitation of this analogy: While the terrain analogy is visually striking, it hasits limitations"
" In particular, it obscures the relation between the horizontal forceand the potential energy curve, since the normal force from the ground on the cart11"
3 Energy Diagrams 323also contributes to the horizontal force
" We will therefore continue our discussionof energy diagrams with other examples, where we can use further properties of thepotential energy curve in our interpretation of the motion"
Energy Diagram of a Spring ForceWe can use an energy diagram to address the motion of a block in a spring
 A blockof mass m is attached to a spring with spring constant k and equilibrium position b
"The block is lying on a horizontal, frictionless table, as illustrated in Fig"
 11
11a
"Model: The only horizontal force on the block is the spring force:F(x) = −k(x − b) , (11"
65)where x is the position of the block
" The net horizontal force on the block is F(x),which only depends on the position x of the block"
 It does not depend on the velocityof the block
 The total mechanical energy of the spring-block system is thereforeconserved throughout the motion:E = U (x) + K = constant 
 (11
66)We found in (11
"33) that the potential energy U (x) of the spring is:U (x) = 12 k(x − b)2 , (11"
67)and this potential energy is illustrated in the energy diagram in Fig

"11 a A block on a frictionless, horizontal plane is attached to a spring"
 b The energydiagram for the block324 11 EnergyFinding motion from the energy diagram: Let us use the energy diagram to de-termine the motion in a few situations
" First, we pull the block from the equilibriumposition x = b to a position x0 > b, and let it go"
" That is, the block starts at theposition x = x0 with zero initial velocity"
" How do we illustrate this in the energydiagram? When we release the block at the position x0 , the block only has potentialenergy"
" That is, at x = x0 , the total energy is:E0 = U0 + K0 = 12 k(x0 − b)2 "
 (11
68)The total energy is given by the intersection between the potential energy curve andthe point x = x0 
 We draw the total energy as a horizontal line through this point asillustrated in Fig
 11
11b
How does the block move? We know that we can read off the kinetic energy asthe distance from the line E = E0 down to the potential energy:K (x) = E0 − U (x) 
 (11
"69)In addition, we know that the spring force on the spring also can be found from thepotential energy curve, because we recall that:F(x) = − dUdx "
 (11
"70)When the motion starts, we know that dU/dx > 0, which means that the force actsin the negative direction, which we of course can verify from the force law in (11"
"65),F(x) = −k (x − b), which is negative when x = x0 > b"
" We see from the energydiagram that as the block accelerates towards smaller values of x, the slope of thepotential energy curve decreases, and therefore the spring force also decreases, untilthe block reaches the point x = b, where dU/dx = 0"
" Motion continues with x < b,but now the force is positive, slowing the block down, until it reaches the point x1 ,where the kinetic energy is zero"
" We see that the force at this point is positive, sincethe slope of U (x) is negative, hence the net force acts in the positive direction: Thespring block is accelerated back towards larger x-values"
 From this point we realizethat the motion repeats itself indefinitely
 The block is oscillating back and forthbetween x1 and x0 
The point x = b is a minimum of the potential energy
" At this point, the net forceis zero, because:F(b) = − dUdx = 0 , (11"
"71)We call all extremal points, where dU/dx = 0, equilibrium points because if theblock starts from this point, there is no force acting on it"
" It will therefore stay at thispoint, in equilibrium"
11
3 Energy Diagrams 325Equilibrium PointsThe simple spring-block system has only one local minimum in the potential energyand no local maximum
 We need a more complex system to discuss the generalbehavior of a system near an equilibrium point
" This is found in the motion of anion trapped between two charged atoms, as illustrated in Fig"
 11
12
" In this case, theenergy diagram contains two local minima and a local maximum"
"Extremal points of the potential energy: What characterizes a local extremum ofthe potential energy function? It is where the potential energy is horizontal, that is,where the slope of the potential energy is horizontal"
" This occurs when:dUdx = 0 , (11"
"72)For an energy diagram, we also know that:F(x) = − dUdx "
 (11
73)The force acting on the system is therefore zero at the extrema of the potential energyfunction
 This is why we call these points equilibrium points
 The equilibrium pointsin Fig
 11
"12 occur at x1 , x2 , and x3 "
"Local minima: What characterizes the behavior around the local minimum at x2 ?If we place the particle exactly at this point with zero velocity, the force acting onthe particle is zero, and the particle will not move"
" What happens if the atom did notstart exactly at x2 , but very close, x = x2 + dx"

12 Top Illustrationof an ion trapped betweentwo charged atoms
" BottomEnergy diagram for the ionx2x1 xE2Ex 3E3x2x1 xx3326 11 EnergyFrom the energy diagram, we see that the energy at x must be slightly higher thanthe energy at x2 , because x2 is a local minimum"
 Figure 11
"12 shows that if the atomstarts at x = x2 + dx, with an energy E2 , the particle will start moving around x2 ,but it will not stray far from the equilibrium point"
 This is also evident directly fromthe properties of U (x)
" You may recall from your experience with calculus, that alocal minimum in U (x) is characterized bydUdx = 0 and d2Udx2 > 0 "
 (11
74)The first derivative is zero and the second derivative is positive
" What is the physicalinterpretation of a positive second derivative? Since the force is related to the firstderivative, this means that: d Fdx < 0 ; , (11"
75)at this point
" Therefore, if the particle is given a small positive velocity, it starts movingin the positive direction"
" But since d F/dx < 0, the force on the particle thereforebecomes negative (since it starts from zero at the equilibrium point)"
" Consequently,the force acting on the particle tends to return the particle back toward the equilibriumpoint"
 You can make a similar argument when the velocity is negative
"Because the particle will be localized close to the equilibrium point when a smallperturbation is applied, we call this equilibrium point a stable equilibrium point"
"Local maxima: What about the local maximum in x = x3 ? Also in this case, theforce acting on the particle when at this point is zero"
 This is therefore also anequilibrium point
" But what happens if we give the particle a small perturbation, asmall increment ΔK to E3 in the total energy? We see from Fig"
 11
12 that in thiscase the particle will not stay close to the equilibrium point
" For any perturbation,the particle will move far away from the equilibrium point—this point is called anunstable equilibrium point"
This argument can also in this case be made from a discussion of the behavior ofthe force F(x) = −dU/dx
" From calculus, you know that for a local maximum, thesecond derivative of U (x) is negative:dUdx = 0 and d2Udx2 < 0 "
 (11
"76)The derivative of the force is therefore positive:d Fdx < 0 , (11"
77)at the unstable equilibrium point
" What does this result in? If we give the particle asmall positive velocity starting from the equilibrium point, the particle will move inthe positive x-direction, and the force acting on the particle will increase—starting11"

Potential energy of the arrow: We have previously (see Sect
 11
"1) found that thepotential energy for an arrow affected by only gravity is:U (y) = mgy , (11"
78)where y is the vertical position of the arrow

" The total energy is conserved and corresponds to a horizontal line, a lineof constant energy, in the energy diagram"
" The potential energy varies with position,U (y) = mgy"
 The kinetic energy can therefore be read from the diagram as thedistance (in energy) from the potential energy and up to the total energy

" Forexample, we could start the motion from y = 0 m with an initial velocity v0 "
 Thetotal energy would then be given byE0 = 12 mv20 + mgy0 = 12 mv20 
 (11
"80)Each horizontal line, E0 , illustrated in Fig"
 11
13 corresponds to a different set ofinitial conditions for the arrow: Each line corresponds to a different motion
"Equilibrium points: What can we say about the motion of the arrow for a giventotal energy? First, we see if the energy diagram has any equilibrium points—pointswhere the derivative of the potential is zero"
 There are no such points: The derivativeof the potential is a constant which is not zero
" Second, we analyze the motion fora given E0 "
 Notice that we can only discuss general features of the motion basedon the energy diagram alone
" From this analysis we do not know at what time thearrow is at a particular position, but we may relate the position and the velocity ofthe arrow"
"Turning points: Since the kinetic energy of the arrow cannot be negative, the arrowcannot propagate into the region where the potential energy is larger than the totalenergy"
" At the point where the potential energy is equal to the total energy, the kineticenergy is zero, which means that the velocity is zero"
 This is the turning point of thearrow: The arrow reverses direction and start moving downwards
 The position withzero velocity is therefore the maximum height of the arrow
Numerical solution and animations: Notice that we can tell several stories basedon the energy diagram
" But for a given set of initial conditions, there is still onlyone resulting motion"
" To illustrate the relation between the motion and the energydiagram, we have illustrated the motion y(t) for an arrow fired from y = 0 m withvarious initial velocities v0 , corresponding to the energies shown in the energy dia-gram"

2 Example: Atomic Motion Along a SurfaceProblem: Let us also revisit the motion of an atom along a surface using energydiagrams: An atom is moving along the x-axis under influence by a surface force
The interaction between the atom and the surface is described by the potential energyof the atom:U (x) = U ∗(1 − cos 2π xb)

"81)Sketch the energy diagram for the atom, find and characterize equilibrium points,and discuss the motion of the atom for various energies"

 11
14
" The potential energyis a periodic function with period b, which we would interpret as a lattice distancein the atomic arrangement of the surface"
"Equilibrium points: Equilibrium points corresponds to positions where the forceon the atom is zero:F(x) = − dUdx = 0 , (11"
82)which also are local extrema of the potential energy function
" Inserting the potentialenergy, we find:F(x) = − ddx U ∗(1 − cos 2π xb)= U ∗ 2πb sin 2π xb = 0 , (11"
"83)which occurs when 2π x/b = πn, where odd numbers n correspond to local maximaand even numbers n, including zero, corresponds to local minima"
 The local maximaare unstable equilibrium points and the local minima are stable equilibrium points

 Two different regimes are evident
" If the total energy is smaller than 2U ∗,the total energy becomes smaller than the potential energy for some values of x"
"Since the total energy is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies:E = U (x) + K (x) , (11"
"84)and the kinetic energy cannot be negative, the atom cannot move into regions wherethe potential energy is larger than the total energy"
 These regions therefore becomeunaccessible to the atom
" For example, if the atom starts near x = 0 and the totalenergy is less than 2U ∗, the atom cannot reach x = b"
" What happens instead? If theatom starts at x = 0 with an initial velocity v0 , the velocity gradually decreases asthe atom moves to the right, until the velocity becomes zero at x = x1 , and the atomreverses direction"
" The atom the accelerates until it reaches x = 0, where the atomagain starts to slow down, until it reaches zero velocity at x = x1 "
" We can find theposition where the velocity of the atom is zero from the total mechanical energy, ifthe atom starts at x = 0 with velocity v0 , the total mechanical energy is:E0 = U (0) + K0 = 0 + 12 mv20 , (11"
85)where U (0) = 0
" The atom reaches its maximum position when the velocity is zero,v1 = 0:E1 = U (x1) + K1 = U ∗(1 − cos 2π x1b)+ 0 "
 (11
"86)We find the position x1 from energy conservation, E0 = E1 :K0 = U ∗(1 − cos 2π x1b)+ 0 ⇒ 1 − K0U ∗ = cos 2π x1b "

3 Energy Diagrams 331which gives:x1 = b2π arccos(1 − K0U ∗)
 (11
88)We notice that if K0/U ∗ becomes larger than 2 there is no solution for x1 
 Thismeans that the atom is free to move along the surface
" Although the velocity of theatom still varies as the atom moves along the surface, the velocity now never reacheszero"
 This also means that the atom does not turn: If it starts moving in the positivedirection it will continue to move in the positive direction indefinitely
Numerical solution and animation: We can relate the motion of the atom to theenergy diagram by finding the motion of the atom for various initial positions andvelocities

4 The Energy PrincipleSo far we have addressed processes where the work is done by conservative forcesonly
 Let us now use what we have learned about potential energy to also discussprocesses with non-conservative forces
" Non-conservative forces are typically forcesthat not only depend on position, but for example also on velocity, such as air resis-tance or friction"
 Let us examine the motion of an object subject to both conservativeand non-conservative forces
"We decompose the net force acting on an object into conservative forces, F j , anda non-conservative force, f:Fnet = ∑jF j + f , (11"
"91)If the object moves from r(t0) = r0 at t0 to r(t1) = r1 at t1 , the net work is:W net0,1 =∫ t1t0Fnet · v dt =∫ t1t0⎡⎣∑jF j + f⎤⎦ · v dt = ∑j∫ t1t0F j · v dt +∫ t1t0f · v dt= ∑j[U (r0) − U (r1)] + W f0,1 = U0 − U1 + W f0,1 "
 (11
"92)The work-energy theorem relates the net work to the change in kinetic energy forthe object:W net0,1 = U0 − U1 + W f0,1 = K1 − K0 "
 (11
"93)We group terms related to position 1 on the left hand side:U1 + K1 = U0 + K0 + W f0,1 "
 (11
"94)If we introduce the term E1 = U1 + K1 for the total (mechanical) energy of theobject, we get:E1 = E0 + W f0,1 , (11"
"95)orE1 − E0 = ΔE = W f0,1 "
 (11
96)The change in the (mechanical) energy of the object is equal to the work done bythe non-conservative force
 This law is a completely general law of nature usuallycalled the second law of thermodynamics or the energy principle:11
4 The Energy Principle 333Energy principle:ΔE = W 
 (11
97)The change in (mechanical) energy is equal to the work done by non-conservative forces (W )
We will later see how we can relate this energy principle for a single object to a moregeneral principle for a system of several objects interacting with its environmentthrough work and heat (thermal energy transfer)

"1 Example: Lift and ReleaseProblem: If you lift a book from the floor to a height h using a constant force F, andrelease it, you have increased the total energy of the book, but the book was affectedby a constant force"
" How can we explain this using the energy principle?Solution: When you are not holding the book, and the book is falling, it is affected bythe gravitational force alone"
 The total mechanical energy of the book (when falling)is therefore:E = U + K = mgy + 12 mv2 
 (11
"98)Initally, the book was lying on the floor with zero velocity"
" In this case, the totalmechanical energy is:E0 = mgy0 + 12 mv20 = 0 J "
 (11
"99)If we choose the potential energy to be zero when the book lies on the floor, that is,when y = 0 m and v0 = 0 m/s"
" When the book is at rest (v1 = 0 m/s) at y1 = h, thetotal mechanical energy is:E1 = mgh + 12 mv21 = mgh "
 (11
100)The change in mechanical energy is therefore:ΔE = E1 − E0 = mgh 
 (11
101)where did this energy come from? It came from the work done by the constant forceF lifting the book to the height h
"W F0,1 = F(y1 − y0) = Fh "
 (11
"102)334 11 EnergyBecause F is a non-conservative force, the energy principle gives that:ΔE = W F0,1 = Fh = mgh "
 (11
103)The work done by F corresponds to the work done by a constant force mg
" But, youprotest, the force F is a conservative force, since it is a constant"
 Something must bewrong with the energy principle!Not so fast
 The force F was constant only when you lifted the book
" Afterwards,you released the book, and this applied force therefore became zero"
 The force Fis therefore not that constant after all
 This is indeed how we should regard such aforce: The force F lifting the book is a time-dependent force
 It only acted when thebook was lifted
 It does not act when the book is released afterwards
 Then it is onlyaffected by gravity
 This is why we call it a non-conservative force
" We could lookat it in a different way: The force F does not only depend on the position y of thebook, because when we lift the book, it is affected by the lifting force, but afterwards,when the book is released, it may be falling through the same position without beingaffected by the lifting force"
" Thus the lifting force is not a conservative force, andwe must use the energy principle to understand the change in mechanical energy ascaused by the work done by non-conservative forces"

2 Example: Sliding BlockProblem: A block is sliding down an inclined plane forming an angle α with thehorizontal
 The kinetic coefficient of friction for the contact between the block andthe plane is μ

" The block slides from position x0 , with initial velocity v0 = 0, to x1 "
 Ourtask is to find the velocity v1 as a function of x1 
Model: Figure 11
"15 shows that the block is affected by the normal force N , friction,f , and by gravity, G"
" Because the block is affected by a non-conservative force, f ,we cannot use energy conservation to find the velocity as a function of position, butwe can still use the energy principle: The change in energy is equal to the work doneby the non-conservative forces"
"ΔE = W f , (11"
"104)where the change in energy isΔE = (K1 + U1) − (K0 + U0) = W f0,1 "

106)where L = x1 − x0 is the distance moved along the plane
" Because the block is notmoving in the y-direction we find the normal force from Newton’s second law:∑ F y = N − G y = N − mg cos α = ma y = 0 , (11"
107)where Fig
 11
15 shows that G y = mg cos α
" The work done by friction is therefore:W f0,1 = −μmgL cos α "
 (11
"108)To find the change in energy, ΔE, we need the change in potential energy of theblock, U1 − U0 "
" Since the normal force does no work, the potential energy is thesame as for motion under gravity alone: U = mgh, where h is the vertical positionof the block"
 Figure 11
"15 shows that Δh = L sin α, andU1 − U0 = mgΔh = −mgL sin α "
 (11
"109)We insert these results in ΔE = W f :ΔE = E1 − E0 = U1 + K1 − (U0 + K0) = K1 − K0 + U1 − U0= 12 mv21 − 0 − mg L sin α = W f0,1 = −mg L cos α "
 (11
110)We rearrange the equation to find:v21 = mgL (sin α − μ cos α) ⇒ v1 = √mgL (sin α − μ cos α) 
 (11
111)336 11 EnergyComment: This demonstrates how to use the energy principle for practical calcula-tions
" We use the same procedure as for energy conservation, but include the workof non-conservative forces"
" In most cases, we need to know the path, r(t) taken bythe object in order to calculate the work done by the non-conservative forces"
 Thismethod is therefore often not that practical

5 Potential Energy in Three DimensionsSo far we have restricted ourselves to one-dimensional motions
 Let us now introducethe potential energy for a three-dimensional motion and a three-dimensional force
We call a force F(r) conservative if the work done by the force from a point 0 toa point 1 is independent of the path taken
" That is, we call a force F(r) conservative,if (and only if) there is a function U (r) so that:W0 to 1 =∫ 10F(r) · dr = U (r0) − U (r1) , (11"
112)for all (possible) paths between r0 and r1 
It is trivial to show that the work is independent of the path if a function U (r)with the property of (11
112) exists
" What about the other way—if the work alongall paths are the same, can we prove that there must exist a function U (r)? This isalso not difficult, since the function is simply defined as the work integral betweenthe two end-points"
"How is the force F(r) and the function U (r) related? Let us look at the work donebetween 0 and 1:W =∫ 10F · dr =∫ 10Fx dx + F y dy + Fz dz︸ ︷︷ ︸=−dU= −∫ 10dU = U (r0) − U (r1) ,(11"
"113)Because U (r) = U (x, y, z), we can write:dU (x, y, z) = ∂U∂ x dx + ∂U∂ y dy + ∂U∂z dz = −Fx dx − F y dx − Fz dz , (11"
"114)consequently,Fx = − ∂U∂ x , F y = − ∂U∂ y , Fz = − ∂U∂z , (11"
115)that is:11
"5 Potential Energy in Three Dimensions 337If the force F is conservative, we can find a function U so thatF = −∇U , (11"
116)We call the function U (r) the potential energy for the force (field) F(r)
Criterion for a conservative force: This means that the criterion for a force to beconservative is a bit stronger in two- and three-dimensions than in one dimension
" Inone dimension, a force F(x) is conservative if F(x) is a function of position alone"
"In two- and three-dimensions, it is a necessary condition that the force F(r) is onlya function of the position, for the force to be conservative"
 But it is not a sufficientcondition
" There are forces F(r) that are only functions of position, but that still arenot conservative"
" In order for the force to be conservative, it must be the gradient ofa potential:F = −∇U "
 (11
"117)From calculus, we know that a force F(r) can be written as a gradient of afunction, if and only if, the curl of F(r) is zero everywhere (for all r):∇ × F = 0 ( for all r) , (11"
"118)because in this case, the integral of all closed curves is zero"

1 Example: Constant Gravity in Three DimensionsProblem: Find the potential energy U (r) for the gravitational force G = −mg j
"Solution: We want to find a function U (r) that satisfies:G = −mg j = −∇U , (11"
"119)Let us try the solution we already know from one dimension:U (x, y, z) = mgy , (11"
120)We find the gradient of U :338 11 Energy∇U =( ∂∂ x i + ∂∂ y j + ∂∂z k)(mgy) (11
121)= ∂∂ x mgy i + ∂∂ y mgy j + ∂∂z mgy k = 0 i + mg j + 0 k 
 (11
"122)This means that the graviational force G is the gradient of the potential U = mgy,that U = mgy is a potential energy (function) also in three dimensions, and that theconstant gravitational force is conservative"

2 Example: Gravity in Three DimensionsProblem: The gravitational force on an object of mass m at position r from an objectof mass M in the origin is:F = − Gm Mr2rr 
 (11
"123)Is this force conservative, and can you find the potential energy for this force?Approach: We know that the force is conservative if the work on the object (ofmass m) does not depend on the path"
" Let us find the work done along a path, anddemonstrate that it is only dependent on the displacement and not on the path"
"Solution: The work done on an object when it is moved along a path r(t) fromr(t0) = r0 to r(t1) = r1 is:W0,1 =∫ 10F · dr =∫ 10− Gm Mr3 r · dr (11"
"124)We introduce a common trick for such integrals: We use that d(r · r) = 2r · dr, andtherefore that r · dr = d ((1/2)r · r), and write the integral as:W0,1 =∫ 10− Gm Mr3 d( 12 r · r)= −Gm M∫ r1r0d( 12 r2)r3 = −Gm M∫ r1r0rr3 dr(11"
"125)This integral does not depend on the path, only on the end-points"
 The gravitationalforce is therefore conservative
"We solve the integral to find the potential energy function:W0,1 = −Gm M∫ r1r0drr2 = − Gm Mr0+ Gm Mr1= U (r0) − U (r1) "
 (11
126)The potential energy function is therefore:U (r) = − Gm Mr 
 (11
127)11
5 Potential Energy in Three Dimensions 339Analyze: We can check this result by calculating the gradient of the potential energyfunction:∇U (r) = −Gm M ∇ 1r = −Gm M( ∂∂ x i + ∂∂ y j + ∂∂z k) 1r (11
"128)Let us calculate the x-component, using that r = (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2 :∇U · i = −Gm M ∂∂ x1r = −Gm M(− 1r2∂r∂ x)= Gm Mr2∂∂ x(x2 + y2 + z2)1/2= Gm Mr212(x2 + y2 + z2)−1/22x = Gm Mr3 x "
 (11
129)And similarly for the y and the z components
" This shows that:∇U = Gm Mr3 r = −F , (11"
130)which proves that U (r) is the potential energy function for the gravitational energy

"3 Example: Non-conservative Force FieldProblem: Show that the force:F = −y i + x j , (11"
"131)is not conservative, even though it depends on the position r alone"
Approach: We can prove that the force is not conservative in several ways
" First,we recall the definition of a conservative force: A force is conservative if the workdone by the force from point 0 to a point 1 is independent of the path"
 Our planis to calculate the work along two different paths
 If they are not the same we canconclude that the force is not conservative
"Solution: We study two different paths, A and B, from r0 = x0 i + y0 j = 0 tor1 = x1 i + y1 j as illustrated in Fig"
 11
16
" Let us calculate the work done along eachpath:Path A: Path A goes as a straight line first from (0, 0) to (x1, 0) (path A1), and thenfrom (x1, 0) to (x1, y1) (path A2)"
 The work alongthese two subpaths are:W A1 =∫A1F · dr =∫ x1x0(−y i + x j) · i dx =∫ x10− y0︸︷︷︸=0dx = 0

 (11
133)The work done by F along path A is therefore:W A = W A1 + W A2 = 0 + x1 y1 = x1 y1 
 (11
"134)Path B: Path B goes as a straight line first from (0, 0) to (0, y1) (path B1), and thenfrom (0, y1) to (x1, y1) (path B2)"

 (11
135)W B2 =∫B2F · dr =∫ x1x0(−y i + x j) · i dx =∫ x10−y1 dx = −y1 x1 
 (11
136)The work done by F along path B is therefore:W B = W B1 + W B2 = 0 − x1 y1 = −x1 y1 
 (11
137)We see that the work done by F along the two paths A and B between the two points0 and 1 are not the same
" The work therefore depends on the path, and the force isnot conservative!Analyze: The force is conservative if and only if it can be written as the gradientof a potential"
" A necessary condition for that, is that the curl of F is zero"
 We cantherefore alos determine is the force is conservative by calculating the curl of F:11

138)The force is therefore not conservative

"6 Energy Conservation as a Test of Numerical SolutionsWhen we are solving the equations of motion based on Newton’s second law, wecan use our general knowledge of physics to check the results"
" This is what we dowhen we first look at the result of a calculation: If it is obviously wrong, we dismissit immediately"
" For example, if you study a falling raindrop with air resistance,you know something is wrong if you calculation tells you the drop is acceleratingupwards"
" Our physical intuition is therefore important both for the interpretation ofthe results, but also for evaluating their correctness"
" However, we can leverage ourknowledge of physics further"
" For example, we can use conservation laws to test theaccuracy of our solutions and of our solution methods"
" This is common practice forworking physicists, and should be a part of your regular professional routine: Alwayscheck for energy (and later momentuum) conservation!Spring-block system: Let us demonstrate this through a simple example: A spring-block system with a block (m = 0"
1 kg) attached to a spring (k = 1000 N/m)
 Weassume that the block is moving along the x-axis and that it is in equilibrium whenx = 0
 If the force from the spring is the only force acting on the block Newton’ssecond law gives: ∑ Fx = −kx = ma ⇒ a = −kx 
 (11
139)Let us calculate the motion starting from x(t0) = 0 m with a velocity v(t0) = v0 
Euler-method solution: In this case we know the exact solution of this equation
"However, let us now rather analyze our numerical solution methods"
 We start byusing Euler’s method
 We find the velocity and position at time ti+1 = ti + Δt fromthe velocity and position at time ti using:v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + a(ti ) Δtx(ti + Δt) = x(ti ) + v(ti ) Δt (11
140)This method is implemented in the following program:from pylab import *m = 0
1 # kgk = 1000 # N/mx0 = 0
0 # mv0 = 1
0 # m/stime = 1
"0 # s342 11 Energyn = 100000dt = time/nt = zeros(n,float)x = zeros(n,float)v = zeros(n,float)x[0] = x0t[0] = 0"
"0v[0] = v0for i in range(n-1):F = -k*x[i]a = F/mv[i+1] = v[i] + dt*ax[i+1] = x[i] + dt*v[i]t[i+1] = t[i] + dtplot(t,x); xlabel(’t (s)’), ylabel(’x (m)’)Validation: The resulting motion is shown in Fig"
 11
17
" However, if we did not knowthe exact solution for the motion, it would be difficult to evaluate if this solution iscorrect"
 Let us therefore check the solution by calculating the total energy of the block
"Because the block is affected by only one force, which depends on the position ofthe block alone, the total energy of the block is conserved"
 In this case we know thepotential energy of the block:U (x) = 12 kx2

6 Energy Conservation as a Test of Numerical Solutions 343The total energy is therefore:E = U (x) + K = 12 kx2 + 12 mv2 
 (11
142)This quantity should be conserved
 We calculate and plot the energy in the programby adding the following lines:U = 0
5*k*x**2K = 0
"5*m*v**2E = U + Kplot(t,E), xlabel(’t (s)’), ylabel(’E (J)’)The result in Fig"
 11
17 shows that the energy is not conserved
 Something maybe wrong
 We know that we always make errors in our numerical integration due tonumerical rounding
" Could this be a result of numerical round-off errors? In addition,we know that the numerical scheme is not exact itself"
 It is only valid in the limitwhen Δt goes to zero and in this limit the effect of round-off error will be important
"Discussion: First, we notice that the errors are rather large"
" We would expect round-off errors to be related to the smallest numbers represented on the machine, and noton the order of 1 % of the value of the energy"
" However, it is often easier to check if theerror is related to the numerical algorithm—we simply reduce the value of Δt and seewhat happens"
 Figure 11
"17 shows that when Δt is reduced, the error is also reduced"
We therefore conclude that the main contribution to the error we are observing comesfrom the numerical method
 Our numerical scheme is not conserving energy for thisequation
" This is, unfortunately, a well-known problem with Euler’s method: Theerror in the numerical solution to even a simple problem like a block in a springincreases with time"
Euler-Cromer method solution: We can fix this by introducing a higher-ordermethod such as Euler-Cromer’s method
 This is done by a simple modification ofthe numerical scheme:v(ti + Δt) = v(ti ) + a(ti ) Δtx(ti + Δt) = x(ti ) + v(ti + Δt) Δt (11
143)This method is implemented by exchanging a single line in the program:x[i+1] = x[i] + dt*v[i]withx[i+1] = x[i] + dt*v[i+1]and the resulting plot of E(t) is shown in Fig
 11
18
" Now, the energy does notdiverge, but instead oscillates around the theoretical, constant value"
 The amplitudeof the oscillations decrease with Δt
 This indicates that the solution method we haveused now is sound

" That is, if the work is independent ofthe path"
Potential energy: For a conservative force F we can write the work from r0 to r1 asa function of the end points:W =∫ 10F · dr = U (r0) − U (r1)The quantity U (r) is called the potential energy and is a positional energy
"Potential energy function in one dimension: For a one-dimensional force, the forceis conservative if and only if it only depends on the position"

The potential energy can be interpreted as an energy landscape for the motion
" Amotion with constant mechanical energy, E = U + K , is illustrated by a horizontalline in this plot"
Equilibrium points: An equilibrium point occurs where the force is zero
 Thiscorresponds to a local extremum of the potential energy
 An equilibrium point isstable in a local minimum and unstable in a local maximum
"Kinetic energy in energy diagrams: The kinetic energy can be found from the plotas the distance from the potential energy up to the line giving the total energy, E"
An object cannot have negative kinetic energy and therefore cannot enter a regionwhere the total energy is less than the potential energy
The energy principle: The energy principle states thatΔE = W N C 
"A change in (mechanical) energy of an object is equal to the work done by non-conservative forces, W N C "
Non-conservative forces: The energy principle can be used in reverse: The workdone by non-conservative forces is equal to the change in mechanical energy:W N C =∫ t1t0FN C · vdt = (K (r1) + U (r1)) − (K (r0) + U (r0))

 Ourfirst discovery is the conservation of mechanical energy
" For an object subject onlyto conservative forces, the mechanical energy is conserved"
 Energy conservationprovides a useful tool when solving problems in mechanics: we can relate the velocityand position of an object without having to find the position as a function of time
"This is particularly useful when the interactions are complicated, and we have limitedknowledge about the forces between objects"
" Actually, it allows us to reason aboutthe behavior of a system without having force models, as long as we know that theforces are conservative"

But we can also integrate Newton’s second law over time:∫ t1t0Fnetdt =∫ t1t0madt = mv1 − mv0 
 (12
"3)If the integral on the left is zero, that is, if the net force is zero, then we find that mvdoes not change"
" This gives us another conservation law: Conservation of momentum,mv"
" But how can that be useful? Didn’t we already know from Newton’s first lawthat if the net external force is zero, the velocity does not change? It turns out thatconservation of momentum is not that useful for a single object, but it is very usefulfor systems consisting of several objects"
" For systems of several objects, we willdemonstrate that the total momentum is conserved if there are no external forcesacting on the system"
" It does not matter what internal forces are acting, the totalmomentum is conserved at all times as long as there are no external forces"
Collisions: Conservation of momentum is particularly useful for collisions
" Duringa collision between two objects, the interactions between the objects can be verycomplicated, and may consist of both conservative and non-conservative forces, butas long as the objects are not affected by any external forces, their total momentum isconserved"
" We use this to find the velocities of each object after a collision from thevelocities before a collision, without finding the motion of each object"
" Conservationof momentum is more general than the conservation of energy, since it is valid forany internal force, and not only for conservative forces"
"Overview: In order to introduce these concepts, we will start by introducing tranla-tional momentum, p = mv"
" We reformulate Newton’s second law using momentum,and find that the integral of the net forces acting on an object corresponds to thechange of momentum"
" We will then use these concepts to address systems withseveral objects, with a particular focus on collisions"

"1 Illustration a collision between a meteor and a planetobjects at some time before the collision, and want to know the velocity of the planetafter the hit"
 Can you do that without having a detailed model for the collision? 1Identify: The meteor impact is illustrated in Fig
 12
1
" We describe the meteor (objectA) with its position rA(t) and its mass m A, and the motion of the planet (object B)with its position rB (t) and its mass m B "
" At some time t0 before the impact you knowthe velocities of both objects, vA(t0) = vA,0 and vB (t0) = vB,0 "
Model: You know you can find the motion of both objects by applying Newton’ssecond law to get an equation of motion
" If we assume that the only interactions arebetween the planet and the meteor, Newton’s second law for objects A and B are:FnetA = Ffrom B on A = m AaAFnetB = Ffrom A on B = m B aB"
 (12
"4)Unfortunately, we do not have a simple force model for the force from the meteoron the planet during the collision"
" How can we then solve the problem?Using Newton’s third law: Fortunately, we can use a common trick: We know thatthe force from the meteor on the planet is the reaction force to the force from theplanet on the meteor: Newton’s third law tells us that:Ffrom A on B = −Ffrom B on A = F "
 (12
"5)1 A model for such a collision would be very complicated, as there are many different processesinvolved"
"354 12 Momentum, Impulse, and CollisionsWe can therefore rewrite Newton’s second law in (12"
4) to be:m AaA = −Fm B aB = F (12
6)which is valid as long as there are no other forces acting on the meteor or the planet
"Now, we see that we can get rid of the unknown force, F, altogether by adding thetwo equations, getting:m AaA + m B aB = −F + F = 0 "
 (12
"7)Integration method: Now, we can integrate this equation, from the initial time t0 ,where we know the velocities, to the∫ t1t0m AaA + m B aB dt = 0 , (12"
"8)m A∫ t1t0aA dt + m B∫ t1t0aB dt = 0 , (12"

 (12
"10)Let us now group the quantities relating to t1 on the left side, and the quantitiesrelating to t0 on the right side:m AvA(t1) + m B vB (t1) = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0) "
 (12
11)This looks like what we have previously found for energy: It is a conservation law

Solve: How can we use (12

"11) actually is valid for all times, also at anytime during the collision"
 But it is not sufficient to find the velocities of each objectafter the collision
" We only know what the awkward sum, m AvA + m B vB is after thecollision"
 We do not know how this sum is distributed between the two objects
" Butsince this is meteor impact we know something else, we know that the two objectsmove as one object after the collision: The meteor and the planet have the samevelocity afterwards:vA(t1) = vB (t1) = v1 "
 (12
13)12
"1 Motivating Example—Meteor Impact 355Now, we can determine the velocity after the collision"
 Starting from (12
11) wehave:m AvA(t1) + m B vB (t1) = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0)m Av1 + m B v1 = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0)(m A + m B ) v1 = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0) (12
"14)v1 = m AvA(t0) + m B vB (t0)m A + m BWe have found the velocity of the planet and the meteor after the collision, withoutsolving the equations of motion!Discussion: The method we applied here is very similar to the energy conservationmethod, but it is based on a different conservation law"
" But notice that we could nothave found the velocity after the collision, if we did not know that the objects weremoving with the same velocity after the collision"
" Since the equation we have usedhere, conservation of momentum, only provides one equation, we cannot use it tofind two velocities"
 We need more equations
 We therefore need to know somethingmore about the collision
" For example, we may use that the energy is conservedduring the collision, or that we know how much energy is lost during the collision"
"In the remaining of this chapter we will more thoroughly introduce the conceptsbriefly mentioned here, and apply the concepts systematically to study two-particleand multi-particle collisions"

"2 Translational MomentumThe translational momentum of an object is defined as:p = mv , (12"
"15)The translational momentum is a property of the object that depends on both theobjects inertial mass, m, and the objects velocity, v"
 The translational momentum isoften also called the linear momentum
" We prefer the term translational momentum todiscern it from rotational momentum, which we encounter when discussing rotationalmotion"
 In the following we use the short term momentum instead of translationalmomentum
"The translational momentum of an object is a vector, which is in contrast toenergy, which is a scalar"
 Translational momentum is a general property that may beextended also to particles without mass
" For example, photons have a translationalmomentum even though they have no mass"
"356 12 Momentum, Impulse, and CollisionsNewton’s Second LawWe have previously introduced Newton’s second law of motion as:∑jFextj = ma "
 (12
"16)However, the most fundamental, and the original, form of Newton’s second law is:∑jFextj = ddt p , (12"
17)The net force acting on an object causes a change in the momentum of the object
"2For an object with constant mass, this formulation reduces to the original formu-lation: ∑jFextj = ddt p = ddt (mv) = dmdt︸︷︷︸=0v + m dvdt = ma "
 (12
"18)This law is a fundamental principle in physics, on the same level as the energy-principle"
" It is the general formulation of Newton’s second law, and we use the termNewton’s second law for this law as well as the special case when the mass is constant"
12
"3 Impulse and Change in MomentumWhat is causing a change in the momentum of an object? Let us study an object thatis affected by a force during a short time interval, such as a tennis ball during a serve"
"While the ball is in contact with the racket, the contact force F(t) on the ball variesas illustrated in Fig"
 12
2
" When the racket makes contact with the ball, the contactforce is small, but it grows rapidly as the racket deforms against the ball"
" As the ballspeeds up, the force decreases while the racket returns to its original shape, until theforce reaches zero as the ball leaves the racket"
"During the collision, other forces such as gravitational forces are negligible com-pared with the contact force from the racket"
 We can therefore assume that the contactforce F(t) is approximately equal to the net force on the ball
The change of momentum of the ball from the time t0 before contact with theracket to the time t1 after the ball has left the racket isΔp = p2 − p1 =∫ t1t0dpdt dt =∫ t1t0F(t) dt 
 (12

 The right side includes both thestrength of the interaction—the force F—and the duration of the interaction
" We callthis quantity the impulse, J, experienced by the object during the collision:Impulse:J =∫ t1t0Fnet(t) dt "
 (12
"20)If the direction of the net force F(t) does not change during the collision, the impulseis directed in the same direction as F(t)"
" In this case, the impulse, J , is the area underthe curve, F(t), in Fig"
 12
2
"Time-Averaged ForceUnfortunately, we generally do not know the time dependency of the net force, sincethis requires a detailed force model for the collision, or a detailed measurement ofthe forces acting"
" Instead, we can use our knowledge of the change in momentum todetermine the average force acting on the ball during the collision"
 The time-averageforce is defined as:Fnetavg = 〈Fext(t)〉 = 1t1 − t0∫ t1t0F(t) dt 
 (12
21)where Δt = t1 − t0 is the duration of the collision
" We define the start of the collisionas the time t0 when the ball comes in contact with the racket (when the contact forcebecomes non-zero), and the end of the collision as the time t1 when the ball losescontact with the racket (when the contact force becomes zero)"

 (12
"22)Momentum Change During a CollisionThe momentum change during a collision gives useful insight into the collision:While the net force may vary throughout the collision, and the maximum force maybe much larger than the average force, the average force is still a reasonable estimatefor the force acting on the object"
" For example, if we want to estimate the damagedone to an object during a collision, the average force is a good estimate also of themaximum force, because for most physical interactions (for most force models), theforce does not display a very narrow peak, but instead varies gradually over a widertime interval, and hence the maximum force is often just a few times the maximumforce"

"Change in momentum: What is the change in momentum of the ball? Since the forceonly depends on the position of the ball, the force is conservative and the mechanicalenergy of the ball is conserved throughout the collision"
" Hence, the kinetic energyof the ball is the same when the ball comes in contact with the surface and when itloses contact with the surface, since the vertical position is the same:E0 = U (y0) + 12 mv20 = E1 = U (y1) + 12 mv21 , (12"

 What is the average net force on the racket during the collision? (c) Youwant to return the ball as a high lob and give the ball a velocity v1 = 15 m/s at angleof 45◦ upward
" What is now the impulse on the ball and the net force from the racketon the ball?Approach: We may solve this problem by determining the motion of the ball fromNewton’s laws of motion, but this would require a detailed force model for the forcefrom the tennis racket on the ball"
" In this case, we do not have such a model"
" Instead,we want to use the measured change in velocity to determine the average force onthe ball"
"Identify: In this problem we address the motion of the tennis ball, described by theposition r(t)"
" The ball starts with the velocity v0 = −v0 i at the time t0 (before thecollision), and gets the velocity v1 after the collision"
"Model: The ball is affected by a force, F(t), from the racket on the ball, and bygravity"
" However, we assume that gravity is small compared with the typical forcefrom the racket, and ignore the effects of gravity"
"Solve: The impulse is defined as the integral of the net force on the ball, and it isequal to the change in momentum of the ball:J = Δp = p1 − p0 = mv1 − mv0 , (12"
"29)Solution part a: In part (a) of the problem, the final velocity is v1 = v1 i"
 The keyidea is that momentum is a vector quantity
" The ball therefore experiences a change inmomentum, even though the magnitude of the momentum does not change, becausethe direction of the momentum changes"

Dicussion: What about gravity? We neglected gravity because we assumed it to besmall compared with the force from the racket
 We could check this assumption intwo ways

"From this calculation we also found the force from gravity, which is much smallerthan the average net force on the ball"

"Solution to part c: Finally, we address question (c), where the collision is not headon, and the ball leaves the racket at an angle α, as illustrated in Fig"

" In this case,we need to treat the collision as two-dimensional"
" First, we introduce the velocity ofthe ball after the collision as:v1 = v1 (cos α i + sin α j) , (12"

4 Isolated Systems and Conservation of MomentumDuring a collision between two objects the forces acting between the objects generallyhave a complicated time dependence—the curve of F(t) is non-trivial
 It is thereforenot a simple task to calculate the impulse integral and use this to determine thechange in momentum of the objects
" Fortunately, it turns out that the problem can besignificantly simplified for an isolated system where the net external force is zero"
In this case the total momentum of the system is conserved throughout the collision
The total momentum is therefore the same before and after the collision
 This is apowerful principle we use to analyze complex interactions without determining thedetailed motion and forces in the system
"364 12 Momentum, Impulse, and CollisionsMomentum and Motion of Two ObjectsWe will now demonstrate that the total momentum is conserved when there are noexternal forces by discussing the collision between two objects A and B, illustrated inFig"
 12
7
 We know that we can determine the motion of each object from Newton’ssecond law of motion applied to each of the objects
" For each object we separate theforces into external forces, forces having an origin outside the system, and internalforces, forces that are acting between the two objects:Internal forces act between the objects in the system"
External forces act between objects in the system and the environment
For the collision in Fig
 12
7 the only internal forces are the forces between theobjects: The force from A on B and the reaction force from B on A
" With thisnotation, Newton’s second law for object A can be written as:∑ FA = ∑ FextA + FB on A = dpAdt , (12"
42)where the sum is over all the external forces acting on object A
" Similarly, Newton’ssecond law for object B is:∑ FB = ∑ FextB + FA on B = dpBdt , (12"
43)where we again have summed over all the external forces acting on object B

44)If we insert this into (12
"43), we get two equations for the motion of object A and B:∑ FextA + FB on A = dpAdt∑ FextB − FB on A = dpBdt (12"
"45)If we add the equations, we get rid of the internal forces, FB on A:∑ FextA + ∑ FextB = dpAdt + dpBdt , (12"

 (12
47)We use this to simplify (12
46):∑ Fext = ddt (pA + pB ) 
 (12
"48)We call the sum of the momenta for each of the objects the total momentum of thesystem:Total momentum:P = ∑ p = pA + pB , (12"
"49)This provides a generalization of Newton’s second law for a two-particle-system:Generalization of Newton’s second law:∑ Fext = ddt∑ p = ddt (pA + pB ) , (12"
"50)366 12 Momentum, Impulse, and CollisionsThis law is completely general"
 We have not made any assumptions about the in-teractions between the two objects
" The internal and external forces may be of anykind, conservative or non-conservative"
 The law is valid in all cases
"Conservation of Momentum in Isolated SystemsAs a special case of this law, we observe that if the net external force on the systemis zero (or negligible), the total momentum of the system is conserved:∑ Fext = 0 ⇒ ddt (pA + pB ) = 0 "
 (12
"51)We call a system isolated if the net external force is zero (or negligible):An isolated system is a collection of objects that may interact internally, butwhere the net external force on all the objects is zero (or negligible)"
"For an isolated system, the total momentum is conserved:pA + pB = constant (for an isolated system) "
 (12
52)• This is a completely general law for the conservation of momentum of a system
It only requires the net external force on the system to be zero
" It is valid not onlyat the beginning and at the end of the collision, but at all times during the collisionas well"
• Notice: A common mistake is to forget the absolutely necessary condition that thenet external force on the system must be zero (or negligible)
" Whenever you employthis law, you should make a habit of always asking yourself if the net external forceis zero, or if it is reasonable to neglect it compared with other forces"
"• Notice that the conservation law is a vector equation, and that it can be valid inone direction independently of an orthogonal direction"
" If the net external forcein the x-direction is zero, the total momentum in this direction is conserved eventhough there is a net external force in the y-direction"
"• Notice that it is not only valid for contact forces, as illustrated in Fig"
 12
"7, but forany type of force, including long-reaching forces such as gravity"
" The gravitationalforces between object in the system are internal forces, while gravitational forcesbetween objects in the system and objects outside the system are external forces"

 The arrows in the top figure illustrates the momentum of the objects
 The bottomfigures show the momentum p x (t) and p y (t) as a function of time
" The total momentum (dottedline) is constant in the x-direction, but is changing in the y-direction due to the net force fromgravity affecting the objectsHow large is the effect of an external force, like gravity in this case? The changein momentum is given by the impulse of the external forces:ΔP = Jext =∫ t1t0Fextdt , (12"
"53)To determine the effect of the external forces, we therefore need to compare thechange of momentum due to the external force, ΔP, to the total momentum of thesystem, P"
" For the gravitational force G = −mgæ, the impulse of gravity is:JG,y =∫ t1t0(−m A g − m B g) dt = − (m A + m B ) Δt , (12"

"4 Isolated Systems and Conservation of Momentum 369If JG  Py , the impulse of the external forces are negligible during the collision, andwe can assume that momentum is approximately conserved"
" Notice that the impulsedepends on the duration of the collision, Δt"
" If the collision takes a short time, themomentum change due to the external forces will be small during the collision, andthe momentum will be approximately conserved from the beginning to the end ofthe collision"
 This is why we often assume that collisions are instantaneous
" Thenwe may assume that the impulse due to external forces is small compared with thetotal momentum, and therefore that the total momentum is approximately conservedin the collision"
Conservation of Momentum for Multi-particle SystemsThe generalization of Newton’s law can be extended to any number of objects
" Fora system with N objects, the total momentum is:P =N∑j=1p j , (12"
56)and the generalization of Newton’s second law is:∑ Fext = ddt P = ddtN∑j=1p j 
 (12
"57)The derivation follows the same principles used for two particle system: Also for theN -particle system Newton’s third law ensures that all internal forces come in pairsthat cancel each other, so that the sum of all the internal forces is zero"
12
"5 CollisionsThe conservation of momentum allows us to determine the velocities of objectsafter a collision from the velocities before a collision without knowing the detailsof the interactions during the collision: We can get by without solving the completeequations of motion, even without knowing the details of the interactions, for allthe objects"
" Let us therefore apply the law we have introduced, the conservation ofmomentum for isolated systems, to address collisions, first in one dimension andthen in two and three dimensions"
"What is a collision? For our purposes, a collision between two objects is a processwhere large forces are acting between the two objects over a short time interval:370 12 Momentum, Impulse, and CollisionsA collision between two or more objects is a process• where the internal forces between the objects are much larger than the ex-ternal forces from the environment• that occur over a short time interval compared to the time scale of the motion"
Collisions Along a LineWe start from the simplest case: a one-dimensional collision between two blocksmoving along a line
 We want to find the velocities of the objects after the collision
"Blocks A and B with masses m A and m B slide along a horizontal, frictionless straighttrack"
" Before the collision, the x-component of the velocities of the blocks are v A,0and v B,0 "
 The blocks collide during a short time interval Δt
 What are their velocitiesafter the collision? The process is illustrated in Fig
 12
10
We assume that the net external force in the x-direction is zero
" Hence, the mo-mentum in the x-direction is conserved, and the total momentum P is the same beforeand after the collision:P0 = P1p A,0 + p B,0 = p A,1 + p B,1m A v A,0 + m B v B,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 "
 (12
58)This equation holds at any time during the collision
" Unfortunately, we cannot find thevelocities after the collision from this equations alone, because there are two unknownvelocities, v A,1 , and v B,1 , but only one equation"
 We need more information aboutthe process—we need an additional equation!We need to know more about the collision process to find another relation betweenthe initial and the final velocities
" For example, if we know that all the forces actingbetween the objects are conservative, we would get an additional equation from theconservation of mechanical energies"
" If the objects are not interacting, which is thecase before and after, but not during the collision, the total energy is equal to thekinetic energies plus a constant potential energy (because the potential energies areconstant when the objects are not interacting):12 m A v2A,0 + 12 m B v2B,0 + U0 = 12 m A v2A,1 + 12 m B v2B,1 + U1 , (12"
59)where U0 = U1 
" In this case, we would have two equations and two unknowns,and we can find one (or a few) unique solutions, which gives us the values of thevelocities after the collision"

10 Illustration of a collision between two blocks A and B showing the situations beforeand after the collision
 Snapshots of the time development are shown in the cartoons
" The force, F,acting between the blocks and the momentum of block A, block B, and the total momentum (dottedline) are all plotted as functions of timeConservation of mechanical energy is one possibility"
" Many things can happenbetween the objects during a collision, which may give rise to other relations andother equations relating the initial and the final velocities"
" It is customary to describecollisions by their degree of energy conservation, ranging from elastic collisions,where mechanical energy is conserved, through various inelastic collisions wheremechanical energy is not conserved, to a perfectly inelastic collision, which corre-sponds to the maximum loss of mechanical energy while still conserving momentum"
We discuss these situations in the following
"372 12 Momentum, Impulse, and CollisionsCoefficient of RestitutionThe energy loss in a collision between two objects is often described by the coefficientof restitution, r"
" For example, we can characterize the collision between a ball and amassive wall by the velocity, v1 , of the ball after the collision:v1 = −rv0 , (12"
60)as a function of the velocity v0 before the collision
" The change in kinetic energy is:E1 − E0 = 12 mv21 − 12 mv20 = (r2 − 1)E0 , (12"
61)This gives the following cases:• A collision is called elastic if the mechanical energy is conserved
 This correspondsto r = 1
• A collision is called inelastic if the mechanical energy is not conserved
 Thiscorresponds to 0 ≤ r < 1
• A collision is called perfectly inelastic the two objects have the same velocityafter the collision
 This corresponds to r = 0
"If you bounce a ball on the floor, we can relate the coefficient of restitution to how highthe ball bounces back up"
" If we drop the ball from a height h0 , the velocity of the ballis given by v20 = 2gh0 before the collision, and v21 = r2v20 = 2gh0 after the collision"
"The maximum height the ball reaches is found from 2gh1 = v21 = r2v20 = r2 2gh0 ,which gives h1 = r2h0 as illustrated in Fig"
 12
11
"The coefficient of restitution for a collision between two objects is defined as:r = − v A,1 − v B,1v A,0 − v B,0"
 (12
"62)(Notice that the definition does not change if we exchange A with B, which isnecessary for such a definition to make sense"
)It is possible to show that r = 0 corresponds to the maximum loss of energy whileconserving momentum
Fig
 12
11 Illustration of aball bouncing on the floorv1 = -v0 v1 = -r v0 v1 = 012
"5 Collisions 373What does r depend on? Since any conservative force would lead to energy con-servation and therefore r = 1, the coefficient of restitution characterizes the non-conservative parts of the contact forces"
" In reality, there are many processes during acollision that result in changes in kinetic energy, such as internal oscillations in theobjects, permanent deformations, and viscous- and frictional forces"
" For a given forcemodel, such as for a spring model with a viscous damping term, we can calculate thevelocity after a collision and therefore determine the coefficient of restitution"
Elastic CollisionsFor an elastic collision between the two blocks A and B in Fig

 (12
"64)Since we are free to choose the coordinate system, we simplify the problem bychoosing a system where block B is initially at rest: v B,0 = 0, giving:m A v A,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 , (12"
"65)m A v2A,0 = m A v2A,1 + m B v2B,1 "
 (12
66)These two equations have a unique solution (see Extra material for a derivation)
"v A,1 = m A − m Bm A + m Bv A,0 , v B,1 = 2m Am A + m Bv A,0 "
 (12
67)These formulas are general
" Let us get to know them by studying a few special cases:Equal MassesIf the two blocks have the same masses: m A = m B , we find that:v A,1 = m A − m Bm A + m B= 0 , v B,1 = 2m Am A + m Bv A,0 = v A,0 "

You are probably familiar with this effect
" You notice it when two equally sizedballs collide head on, such as two billiard balls"
"Collision with a Large MassWhat happens if block A collides with a large, stationary mass? That is, if m B m A"
We expect this to be like a collision with a stationary wall
" We find:v A,1 = m A − m Bm A + m Bv A,0 = (m A/m B ) − 1(m A/m B ) + 1 v A,0 −v A,0 , (12"

"Similarly, for v B,1 :v B,1 = 2m Am A + m Bv A,0 0 , (12"

"Collision with Small MassWhat happens if block A collides with a tiny block B? That is, if m A m B ? Wefind that:v A,1 = m A − m Bm A + m Bv A,0 = 1 − (m B /m A)1 + (m B /m A) v A,0 v A,0 , (12"

"72)If a large object collides head on into a much smaller, stationary object, the largeobject continues with approximately the same velocity, but the small object is shotforward with twice the velocity of the large object (see Fig"

"Collisions and Relative MotionSo far we have only addressed the case when block B starts at rest, but our solutionsare more general than you may believe: We can use a coordinate system change tomap any collision onto the solutions we have found"
" Let us demonstrate how to dothis by addressing an elastic collision between a ball (object A) with mass m A and amoving wall, the much more massive object B: m B m A"
The situation is illustrated in Fig
 12
13
" Before the collision the velocity of theball is v A,0 and the velocity of the wall is v B,0 measured relative to a coordinatesystem S, which we call the laboratory system"
" However, if we follow the motion ofthe wall, in the system S′, the wall has velocity zero before the collision: v′B,0 = 0"

" We apply this to thecurrent situation, where system S′ is moving with the (initial) velocity of the wallu = v B,0 , we get:v′A,0 = v A,0 − u = v A,0 − v B,0 , (12"

"69) todetermine the velocity after the collision in the S′ system:v′A,1 = −v′A,0 = − (v A,0 − v B,0) "
 (12
"77)We find the velocity in the original system by the reverse transformation:v A,1 = v′A,1 + u = v′A,1 + v B,0 = −v′A,0 + v B,0= − (v A,0 − v B,0) + v B,0 = 2v B,0 − v A,0 , (12"
"78)This is what happens when a ball hits a wall that moves toward the ball, such as a col-lision between a golf club (massive) and a golf ball (small mass)"
 Similar techniquescan be used to address other solutions
General Solutions to Elastic CollisionsWe can find the general solution for an elastic collision between blocks A and B asillustrated in Fig

"81)In this case, only the total momentum is conserved, and not the kinetic energy"
"Conservation of momentum gives:m A v A,0 + m B v B,0 = m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 , (12"
"82)Velocity After Perfectly Inelastic CollisionIn the case when v B,0 = 0, we find:m A v A,0 = m A v1 + m B v1 = (m A + m B ) v1 , (12"

84)Loss of Energy After Perfectly Inelastic CollisionThe mechanical energy is not conserved for a perfectly inelastic collision
 This meansthat the initial kinetic energy of the system is transformed into thermal energy andhas been used to deform the objects permanently
 The perfectly inelastic collisiongives the maximum loss of energy

1 Example: Ballistic PendulumProblem: A 10 g bullet is fired into a 1 kg wooden block hanging in a 1 m long rope
The block reaches a height 30 cm above its initial level
 (a) What was the velocity ofthe bullet? (b) What was the loss of energy in the system?Identify: In this problem we address the motion of two objects: The bullet (objectA) and the block (object B)
 The block is hanging from a massless rope
 This meansthat the block behaves as a pendulum after the collision between the bullet and thependulum
" After the collision, the block swings to a height h above its initial position"
The process is illustrated in Fig
 12
14
"Model: In this problem, we do not know the detailed interactions between the bulletand the block"
" Therefore, we use conservation laws to address the collision betweenthe bullet and the block"
 The bullet becomes stuck in the block—this means that thebullet and the block has the same velocity after the collision—the collision is perfectlyinelastic
" Before the collision the bullet has a horizontal velocity, vA,0 = v0 i, andthe block is at rest, vB,0 = 0"
" After the collision, both objects have the velocityvA,1 = vB,1 = v1 i"
Solution to part a: There are no external forces acting on the system in the x-direction during the collision
 (There may be forces acting on the system in they-direction—depending on the motion of the system and the effect of the rope

") From Newton’s second law in the x-direction weget: ∑ Fx = 0 = ddt( p A,x + p B,x) "
 (12
"89)The total momentum in the x-direction is therefore conserved during the collision:m A v A,0 + m B v B,0︸︷︷︸=0= m A v A,1 + m B v B,1 ⇒ v1 = m Am A + m Bv A,0 "
 (12
"90)In the second part of the process, the block and bullet swings up as a pendulum"
"In this process, the rope does not do any work on the system, and we assume thatthe air resistance is negligible"
 The only force doing work on the system is thereforegravity
" In this second part of the process, the mechanical energy is conserved!Notice that in this case the process consists of two separate subprocesses"
" In thefirst subprocess, the collision, the mechanical energy is not conserved, but in thesecond subprocess, the swinging pendulum, the mechanical energy is conserved"
We use energy considerations to determine how high the pendulum swings
" Themechanical energy at the beginning of this motion, immediately after the collision,is the same as the mechanical energy when the pendulum has reached its maximumheight"
 At its maximum height the kinetic energy of the pendulum is zero
 Conser-vation of mechanical energy therefore gives:12 (m A + m B ) v21 = (m A + m B ) gh ⇒ h = v212g =( m Am A + m B)2 v202g

 (12

Non-central Elastic CollisionsSo far we have only studied one dimensional collisions—collisions where all theobjects move along a line so that all velocities also are directed along the line
 Suchcollisions are called central collisions:In a central collision the momentum of both objects is directed along the linebetween the two objects before and after the collision

Notice that we still do not have enough equations to determine the vectors:We have 3 equations, but 4 unknown components in the velocity vectors after thecollision"
 In order to determine the velocities after the collision we need more in-formation about the collision
 We need to know something about the force actingbetween the particles throughout the collision

6 Modeling and Visualization of CollisionsWe can gain better insights into the concepts introduced in this chapter by studyingcollisions in detail
" If we know the details of the interactions between two objecst,that is, if the have models for the interaction forces, we can find their motion fromNewton’s second law"
"Let us use this to get a better understanding of elastic, inelasticand perfectly inelastic collisions"
"We model two objects, A and B, with masses m A and m B "
" The force from B onA is:FB on A = F(rA, rB , vA, vB ) , (12"
"117)and from Newton’s third law, we know thatFA on B = −F "
 (12
"118)For example, for two solid spheres of radius R, a reasonable force model is:F ={ k |Δr − 2R| ΔrΔr − η (Δv) , Δr < 2R0 , Δr ≥ 2R , (12"

 These conditions will resultin an non-central collision
" Then, we define the parameters used by the force model,such as the force constant k and the viscous term η"
 We choose an unrealisticallysmall value for k in order to make the collision extend over some time so that we canobserve the interactions during the collision

 Reasonable values for η are in the range 1 kg/s < η < 10 kg/s

7 Rocket EquationA rocket accelerates forward by ejecting exhaust backward at high velocity
 Therocket is essentially throwing out mass backward in order to move forward
 How canwe address the motion of a rocket using Newton’s second law?We start from a specific example: A rain drop is falling down through the at-mosphere and on the way it adsorbs water vapor that condensates on the drop
 Letus address the motion of the drop over a small time interval from t to t + Δt
 Duringthis time interval the drop adsorbs a small drop of mass Δm and initial velocity u
At the time t the mass of the drop is m and its velocity v
" At the time t + Δt, themass is m + Δm and the velocity has changed to v + Δv"

18 Illustration of object trajectories and p x (t) and p y (t) throughout the collisionThe change in momentum of the drop is related to the external forces acting onthe drop
" What is the change in momentum? At the time t, the total momentum (ofthe drop and the small drop being adsorbed) is:p(t) = mv + Δmu (12"
"121)after the time interval Δt, the small drop is adsorbed, and the new momentum is:p(t + Δt) = (m + Δm) (v + Δv) = mv + mΔv + Δmv + ΔmΔv "
 (12
122)The change in momentum is therefore:Δp = p(t + Δt) − p(t) = mΔv + (v − u) Δm + ΔmΔv 
 (12
123)Newton’s second law for the system related the change in momentum to the netforces acting on the system:∑ Fext = ΔpΔt = m ΔvΔt + (v − u) ΔmΔt + Δm ΔvΔt 
 (12
124)12
7 Rocket Equation 389This is only valid in the limit when Δt → 0
" If we assume the adsorption processalso to be continuous, the change in mass and the change in velocity also goes tozero when Δt goes to zero"
" Hence, the term:Δm ΔvΔt → 0 when Δt → 0 "
 (12
125)In the limit of small Δt we therefore find the Rocket equation:Rocket equation:∑ Fext = dpdt = m dvdt + (v − u) dmdt 
 (12
126)The rocket equation is used to describe the motion of an object that is expelling oradsorbing mass with a velocity u
" A special case is when the expelled or adsorbedmass has zero velocity, u = 0:∑ Fext = dpdt = m dvdt + v dmdt (12"
127)which is what we get when taking the derivative of p = mv with a time-dependentmass
"For a rocket, we may not generally know at what speed relative to the groundthe exhaust is ejected, but rather at what speed relative to the rocket the mass isexpunged"
" We introduce the velocity of Δm relative to m as:vrel = u − v , (12"
128)using this notation we can write the rocket equation (12
126) as:Rocket equation: ∑ Fext + vreldmdt = m dvdt 
 (12
"129)Written in this form, the equation looks like the usual formulation of Newton’s secondlaw, and we interpret all the terms on the left side as forces, and the term on the rightside is the mass multiplied by the acceleration"
" Expelling mass with a velocity vrelrelative to the object at a rate dm/dt, has the same effect as pushing on the objectwith a force:F = vreldmdt "

1 Example: Adding Mass to a Railway CarProblem: A railway car is moving with constant velocity along a straight railwaytrack
" While it is moving, sand is dropped onto the car from above at a constant rate,R = dm/dt, as illustrated in Fig"
 12
19
" With how large force, F, must the car bepulled in order for the car to move with constant velocity?Solution: We use the rocket equation to relate the forces acting on the car to itsacceleration"
" The only horizontal force acting on the car is the external force F,friction and air resistance"
 We assume that friction and air resistance forces arenegligible
 The sand is falling onto the car from above
 This means that the sand hasa vertical velocity but no horizontal velocity as it hits the car
" We can therefore usethe rocket equation, with u = 0:∑ Fext = (v − u) dmdt + m dvdt , (12"
"131)The net horizontal force on the car is F = F i, and the velocity is constant, dv x /dt =0, and the velocity u x = 0 therefore:F = (v x − u x ) dmdt + m dvdt = (v x − 0) dmdt + m × 0 = v dmdt "
 (12
132)The force is therefore given by the velocity and the rate at which mass is added

 Find how the velocityincreases as the fuel is used
12
7 Rocket Equation 391Solution: Let us describe the motion with the x-axis directed forward—in the direc-tion of motion of the rocket
 The rocket starts with the velocity v0 = 0
" We use therocket equation to find an expression for the velocity of the rocket:∑ Fext + vreldmdt = m dvdt , (12"
"133)Here, the net external force is zero, and all motion is in the x-direction:− vreldmdt = m dvdt ⇒ dvdt = −vrel1mdmdt "
 (12
"134)We find the velocity by integrating from t0 to t1 :∫ t1t0dvdt dt = −vrel∫ t1t01mdmdt dt = −vrel∫ m(t1)m(t0)dmm , (12"
135)which givesv(t1) − v(t0) = −vrel (ln m(t1) − ln m(t0)) = −vrel ln m(t1)m(t0) 
 (12
136)This is the increase in velocity of the rocket as the mass changes from m(t1) to m(t0)
"We notice that the velocity is increasing, since the final mass, m(t1) is always smallerthan the initial mass m(t0)"
"SummaryTranslational momentum: is defined as p = mvNewton’s second law: on general form is: ∑ Fext = dp/dtImpulse: Change in momentum is related to the impulse, J, of the net force:J =∫ t1t0Fextdt = p(t1) − p(t0) "

 In this project you will learn about collisions and conser-vations laws by studying the behavior of Newton’s cradle
 Newton’s cradle is a toyconsisting of a series of steel balls each suspended by two strings so that the ballsform a horizontal line when the cradle is at rest
 The balls are initially barely touch-ing each other
 You can play with the toy by lifting and releasing a ball on one side

 Find the maximum height h1 reachedby the right ball after the collision
"Assume the collision is characterized by a coefficient of restitution, r"
 The relativevelocity after the collision is then related to the relative velocity before the colisionby v B1 − v A1 = rv0 
(e) Find the velocities of each of the balls after the collision
"We will in the following study a system with three balls, A, B, and C"
" We willassume that all forces are conservative, so that all collisions are elastic"
" Initially,immediately before the collision, ball A has a positive velocity v0 and the other ballsare not moving"
"396 12 Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions(f) Let us assume that the balls are seperated by small distances, so that there aretwo collisions, first between ball A and B and then between B and C"
" What are thevelocities of the balls after the first collision? And after the second?Let us now assume that all the balls are initially in contact, so that we cannotassume that there are two seperate, subsequent collision"
 This is the configurationcorresponding to Newton’s cradle
(g) Find equations relating the initial and final velocities of all three balls
" Can yousolve these equations?In order to understand what happens in Newton’s cradle when all the balls areinitially in contact, we will develop a simple, numerical model of the process"
" In thenumerical model we will only address the collision itself, and we will assume thatthe motion of all the balls is one-dimensional along the x-axis during the collision"
"We introduce an explicit model for the forces between the balls, and use this tocalculate the motion of all the balls throughout the collision using Newton’s secondlaw for each of the balls"
"The position of the balls are given as x i , i = 0, 1, 2"
" At the beginning of thecollision, at t = 0, all the balls are just in contact, so that the distance between themis equal to their diameters, d, x i = i d"
"The force on ball i from ball i + 1 is modelled using a simple, position-dependentforce on the formFi,i+1 ={ −k |x i+1 − x i − d|q when x i+1 − x i < d0 when x i+1 − x i ≥ d "

"Chapter 13Multiparticle SystemsSo far we have studied the motion of objects, but we have not been very precisein defining an object"
" What we really have studied is the motion of mass-points,particles, or extended objects that move as a particle"
" What does it mean to moveas a particle? It means that all the points in the object move with the same velocityand the same acceleration, the whole object is translated as a stiff (rigid) body: Thevarious parts of the object are not moving relative to each other"
But this does not seem to be a good description of everyday phenomena around us
"If you are running, you are surely not moving both your arms and your legs with thesame velocity and acceleration all the time"
" And if you throw a ball, it may wobbleand spin on its path"
" Even on the microscopic level objects are not only translated:Molecules may vibrate, spin, or wobble as they move"
" When the world is so complex,can we still use the simple descriptions and models we have developed so far, or dowe have to describe the motion of each small part of the object independently?Fortunately, we are saved by Newton’s third law: If we only define the positionof the object in a particular way, by defining the position of the object as its centerof mass, Newton’s second law is valid for any system of particles, and therefore forany object"
 This wonderful consequence of Newton’s second and third laws allowsus to use the force models and the concepts we have developed so far also to addressextended objects
" The motion of an object is further simplified if the object is a rigidbody: An object where the relative positions of any two points do not change, thatis, the object is only translated and rotated, but does not change shape, stretch, orotherwise deform during its motion"
"In this chapter, we discuss the motion of systems of particles—multiparticle sys-tems"
 Before we proceed to describe the motion of rigid bodies in Chaps

1 Motion of a Multiparticle SystemLet us start describing a system of many particles
" For most practical purposes,two particles are many particles, but we are ambitious and start with a system ofN particles"
 We number the particles using the index j running from 1 to N as© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015A

1 The motion of asystem of particles isdescribed by the position r jof each of the N particles inthe system
" Here, the systemconsists of 5 particlesxymimjFj,iFiext vir ir jxymir iRillustrated in Fig"
 13
1
 The position of each particle is given in a coordinate systemS as illustrated
" The position of particle 1 as a function of time is r1(t), and its massis m1 "
" Similarly, the position of particle j is r j and its mass is m j "
All the quantities we have defined so far are easily extended to each of theseparticles
" For example, the velocity and acceleration of particle j is found from thederivatives of the position vector:v j = dr jdt , a j = dv jdt , (13"
1)and the momentum of particle j is p j = m j v j 
The motion of each particle is determined from the forces acting on it
" In ourdiscussion of momentum, we already discussed that the forces acting on particle jmay be either from one of the other particles in the system, or from the environment"
"Forces from other particles in the system are called internal forces, and forces fromthe environment are called external forces"
" Newton’s second law for particle i istherefore:Fneti = Fexti + ∑j =iF j,i = ddt pi , (13"
"2)where F j,i is the force from particle j on particle i"
"In order to find the motion of one of the particles inside the system, we need toknow both the external forces acting on this particle and the forces from the otherparticles in a system"
" This may require a complicated force model, for example,consider the forces acting between two parts of a tennis ball as the ball wigglesand rotates"
" Often, we are not interested in the detailed motion of particles insidea system, but only in the motion of the system as a whole"
 We can address this byadding together (13
"2) for each particle i, getting:∑iFneti = ∑iFexti + ∑i∑j =iF j,i︸ ︷︷ ︸=0= ∑iddt pi , (13"
3)13
"1 Motion of a Multiparticle System 403As we noticed when we discussed the total momentum of a system of particles, thesum of all the internal forces will always contain both the force F j,i and the forceFi, j "
" Since these two forces are action-reaction pairs, they are equal, but oppositelydirected"
" Therefore, every such pair will cancel"
" The sum of all the internal forces istherefore zero!If we introduce P = ∑i pi as the total momentum of the system, we find:∑iFexti = ddt P , (13"
"4)This looks a lot like Newton’s second law, but now for the system of particles"
" Wecan make this similarity even stronger by introducing the velocity V of the systemso that:P = MV = ∑ipi = ∑im i vi , (13"
5)where M = ∑i m i is the total mass of the system
Notice that this is a definition of the velocity V of the system
" We define it thisway to be able to write the total momentum, P, of the system in the intuitive wayP = MV"
 From (13
5) we find:V =∑i m i vi∑i m i= 1M∑im i vi 
 (13
"6)What is the acceleration of the system? It is natural to define the acceleration, A, ofthe system as the time derivative of the velocity V of the system:A = ddt V = 1M∑im i ai "
 (13
"7)Similarly, we define the position of the system, R, as:Center of mass: The effective position of the system, or the center of mass ofthe system, is defined asR = 1M∑im i ri , (13"
"8)404 13 Multiparticle SystemsThe velocity and acceleration of the center of mass are defined in the usual way:V = dRdt , A = d2Rdt2 "
 (13
9)With these definitions:Newton’s second law for a system of particles: is system as:∑iFexti = ddt P = MA 
 (13
10)where M = ∑i m i and P = ∑ pi 
(where we have assumed that the masses of the particles are constant)
"This law, Newton’s second law for a system of particles, is what we have beenlooking for"
 Equation (13
"10) shows that if we define the position of the system in thisparticular way, we can use Newton’s law exactly as we are used to, just rememberingthat we are not describing the motion of each particle separately, but instead wedescribe the motion of the effective position R of the system"
This law is powerful and surprisingly beautiful
 It is the theoretical justificationfor why we do not have to care too much about whether we describe the motion ofan object as a point or as a system of particles
 We can describe the motion of anysystem of particles as a point: The center of mass R of the system
In the next sections we build our intuition about the center of mass R of a systemand we learn to apply Newton’s second law for a system of particles
13
2 The Center of MassWhy do we call the effective position R the center of mass? Let us start by addressthis in a two-particle system
" The effective position, R, of the two-particle system is:R = 1M (m1r1 + m2r2) "
 (13
"11)If the two masses are identical, we see that:R = m1r1 + m2r2m1 + m2= mr1 + mr2m + m = 12 (r1 + r2) , (13"
12)which is the midpoint between the two points

" Wefind the center of mass of thewhole systemxyi=1,kRAi=k+1,NRBRWe get a similar result for the N -particle system: When all the masses are thesame, the effective position R is:R = 1N∑iri , (13"
13)as illustrated in Fig
 13
1
 This is simply the arithmetic mean of the position vectors
"As long as all the masses are the same, the center of mass is what we typicallywould call the geometric center of the points"
" What happens when the masses arenot equal? In this case, we weigh in the masses in the average, so that the centerof mass is the mass-weighed average of the positions of the particles-which is thenatural definition of the center of mass of an object"
Notice that the center of mass R is a vector
" We can therefore calculate the centerof mass for each component, along each axis, independently of the other axes"
"The Subdivision PrincipleIf we combine two systems A and B, where we know the center of mass for eachthese systems, how can we find the center of mass for the whole system?The situation is illustrated in Fig"
 13
2
" Each of the systems could be a rigid body,or just a collection of point masses"
" System A has total mass M A and a center ofmass at RA, and system B has a total mass M B and center of mass at RB "
Let us enumerate all the particles using the index i
" The first k particles are insystem A, and the last N − k particles are in system B"
" What is the center of mass,R, of the whole system with mass M = M A + M B ?The definition of R is:MR = ∑im i ri =k∑i=1m i ri +N∑i=k+1m i ri = M ARA + M B RB , (13"
14)and therefore:R = M ARA + M B RBM A + M B
 (13
"15)We can therefore find the center of mass of a system of two objects A and B, byassuming that object A and B are point masses with the whole mass of each object406 13 Multiparticle Systemslocated in the center of mass of each object"
" This means that if we want to find thecenter of mass of two solid bodies, we can find the center of mass of each object,and then find the center of mass of the combined object by assuming each object tobe a point mass"
Solid BodiesSo far we have only defined the center of mass of a system of a finite number ofparticles
 How can we find the center of mass of a solid body?The definition of the center of mass for a continuous object follows directly fromthe definition for a system of many particles
 We divide the solid body into smallvolumes ΔVi = Δx i Δyi Δz i at the position ri 
" The center of mass is:R = 1M∑im i ri , (13"
"16)where the mass of the volume element ΔVi depends on the local mass density, ρ(ri )"
"When the size of the volumes goes to zero, the sum approaches the integral of themass density of the volume, V , of the solid body:R = 1M∫ ∫ ∫Vr ρ(r) d V "
 (13
"17)In physics, we often write this as an integral over the mass elements dm instead:R = 1M∫Mr dm "
 (13
"18)In order to calculate the integral, we calculate the values for each of the componentsseparately:M X =∫ ∫ ∫Vx ρ(x, y, z) dx dy dz , (13"
19)and similarly for the Y and Z components

" We integrate x from 0 to a, and y from 0 and up to the linecorresponding to the upper boundary of the triangle"
" This is a line going through thepoints x = 0, y = b and x = a, y = 0"
 The straight line through these points hasthe equation y = b(1 − x/a)

"28)which, of course, is the well know formula for the area of a triangle multiplied withthe mass density ρ of the triangle"

" The image is taken from a classroom experiment,where we have extracted a smaller part of the image for analysis (see Fig"

" However, we cannot use these color valuesdirectly to find the center of mass"
" Instead, we need to know if a pixel at (x, y) is apart of the object or not"
" We therefore set a threshold on the image, so that all pixelsthat are brighter than this threshold is included (set to value 1), and all the rest of thepixels are set to zero (Fig"

"3 Newton’s Second Law for Particle SystemsWe have found that if we measure the position of a system of particles using thecenter of mass, R, of the system, the system behaves according to Newton’s secondlaw:∑ Fext = MA , (13"
"35)where A is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system of particles, and thesum is over all external forces"
" This is true for any system of particles, from a galaxyconsiting of starts, to the solar system, to a rigid body consiting of a large numberof invididual atoms, down to a molecule or even an atom: The acceleration of thecenter of mass is given by the external forces acting on the system"
"It is this law that allows us to use the techniques we have developed so far on anysystem, a solid body or a system of particles"
 In the previous chapters we have strictlyspeaking only discussed the motion of point-particles with a mass
 We have alwaysassumed that every part of a solid body has been moving with the same velocity
" Wehave not allowed the object to oscillate, vibrate, change shape, or rotate"
 We have notallowed it to do any of the things that real objects do
" However, we have now beensaved by Newton’s second law for particle systems: If we measure the position ofan object as the center of mass of the object, we can still use Newton’s second lawto find its motion, even if the object is vibrating, oscillating, rotating, or displayingother types of internal motion"
"If I throw a ball through the room, we have previously found that the motion ofthe ball can be found from Newton’s second law for the ball:∑ F = G = −mg j = ma "
 (13
36)The beauty of Newton’s second law for particle systems is that we can use exactlythe same analysis for a spinning or oscillating ball
 The motion of the center of massof the ball only depends on the external forces acting on the ball:∑ F = G = −mg j = mA 
 (13
"37)It does not matter what happens internally in the ball—if it is deformed, spinning,or vibrating—the motion of the center of the mass is the same as for a point particleas long as the external forces acting are the same"
13
"3 Newton’s Second Law for Particle Systems 413However, you might argue that the external forces acting on a spinning ball aredifferent because of air resistance: It is the interaction with the air that causes aspinning ball to move sideways, which is called curving the ball"
 This is a validobjection
 The motion of the center of mass is determined by the external forcesacting on the object
" But, if we can neglect the effects of air resistance, the motionof the center of mass of a rod when you throw it is the same when it is rotating aswhen it is not rotating"
" This may be surprising, but it is a result of Newton’s secondlaw for particle systems"

1 Example: Ballistic Motion with an ExplosionProblem: A projectile is fired from the ground
 Its initial velocity in the horizontaldirection is v0 
" When it reaches its maximum height of h, a charge is set off, splittingthe projectile into two equal parts"
 One part moves forward with the velocity v1 
" Findthe trajectory of each of the parts, and the trajectory of their center of mass"
 You mayneglect air resistance
Solution: We have illustrated the process in Fig
 13
8
 The process has three stages
"In stage one, the projectile moves to its maximum height only under the influence ofgravity"
" In the second stage, the explosion takes place, after which the projectile issplit into two projectiles"
" In the third stage, each part propagates to the ground onlyaffected by gravity"

"8 A projectile explodes at the top of its path, splitting into two equal pieces"
" We track theposition of each part until they hit the ground414 13 Multiparticle SystemsModel: First, let us address the explosion"
" During the explosion, each part of theprojectile is subject to large forces"
 But the only external force acting on the parts isgravity
" Consequently, there is no external horizontal force acting on the system"
 Thehorizontal momentum is therefore conserved at all times
" In particular, the momen-tum is the same immediately before and immediately after the explosion"
 We useconservation of momentum to determine the horizontal velocities of the parts afterthe explosion
"Before the explosion, the horisontal momentum of the system is:p0 = mv0 , (13"
"38)and after the collision, the horizontal momentum is:p1 = m A v A + m B v B = m2 v A + m2 v B "
 (13
"39)Conservation of momentum gives:v0 = 12 v A + 12 v B , (13"
"40)where v B = v1 is the velocity of part B after the explosion, and v A is the velocity ofpart A, which we need to find:v A = 2v0 − v B = 2v0 − v1 "
 (13
41)We therefore know the initial conditions for the motion in the third stage
" Each partis affected by gravity alone: GA = −m A g j, GB = −m B g j"
"Finding the motion of part B: First, we find the motion of part B"
 Newton’s secondlaw in the x-direction gives:∑ Fx = 0 = m B a B 
 (13
42)The velocity in the x-direction is constant
" The position is therefore:x B (t) = x B (t0) + v B t = v0t , (13"
43)where we have placed the origin at the ground directly below the explosion
 Thereforex B (t0) = 0
"The motion in the y-direction corresponds to the motion of a falling object, hence:y B (t) = h − 12 gt2 "
 (13
44)13
"3 Newton’s Second Law for Particle Systems 415Finding the motion of part A: Similarly, we find the position of part A:x A(t) = v A t = (2v0 − v1) t , y A(t) = h − 12 gt2 "
 (13
"45)We notice that the motion in the y-direction is the same for the two parts, which isas expected"
 The two parts will therefore strike the ground at the same time
Finding the motion of the center of mass: We use these results to find the centerof mass:R =∑i m i ri∑i m i
 (13
46)We find the x- and y-components independently:X =∑i m i x i∑i m i=m2 x A + m2 x Bm2 + m2= 12 (x A + x B ) = 12 ((2v0 − v1) t + v1t) = v0t 
(13
47)This is what we get if we apply Newton’s second law for a particle system
" There areno external horizontal forces acting on the system, therefore the horizontal componentof the center of mass moves with constant velocity:∑ Fext = −mg j = mA ⇒ A x = 0 ⇒ X = v0t "

48)We see that Newton’s second law for particle systems gives the same result as whenNewton’s second law is applied to each object
"Similarly, we find the y-position of the center of mass:Y =∑i m i yi∑i m i=m2 y A + m2 y Bm2 + m212 (y A + y B ) (13"
"49)= 12(h − 12 gt2 + h − 12 gt2)= h − 12 gt2 , (13"
50)We could also have found this directly from Newton’s second law for particle systems:∑ Fext = mA = −mg j ⇒ A y = −g ⇒ Y (t) = Y (t0) − 12 gt2 = h − 12 gt2 
(13
"51)Analyze: We have demonstrated that we can find the motion of the center of masseither by calculating the motion of each of the parts of the system, or we can find themotion of the center of mass by applying Newton’s second law for particle systemsdirectly"
 The results are of course the same
" However, there are many questions416 13 Multiparticle Systemswe only can answer if we know the motion of each part"
" For example, in order todetermine how far apart the two parts are when they hit the ground, we need to findthe motion of each of the parts"
13
4 Motion in the Center of Mass SystemNewton’s law for multiparticle systems gives us the tool to determine the motion ofthe center of mass of a complex object based on the external forces acting on thesystem
 The law is surprisingly robust
" If you throw a rod through the air, and youneglect the effects of air resistance, the motion of the center of mass of the rod doesnot depend on how the rod is moving relative to its center of mass: The motion of thecenter of the mass is the same if the rod is moving as a ridig body without rotating,as in Fig"
 13
"9a; if the rod is rotating around its center of mass, as in Fig"
 13
9b; or ifthe rod is rotating and wobbling
 The motion of the center of mass of the rod doesnot depend on internal forces in the rod
" Therefore, the motions of individual partsrelative to the center of mass do not affect the motion of the center of mass"
"However, in many cases we are interested in both the motion of the center ofmass and of the motion of the individual parts relative to the center of mass"
" Forexample, we may be interested in the rotation of the rod, or its wobbling, or in howit is vibrating"
 Then it is useful to split the motion of the system into the motion ofthe center of mass and the motion of a particle relative to the center of mass
Fig

 13
"10 The position of a point on the rod ri can be written as a sum of the position of the centerof mass, R, and the position of the point relative to the center of mass, rcm,iLaboratory and Center of Mass SystemsWe have already discussed how we always measure the motion of a system relativeto some reference system"
" For example, we may characterize the motion of therod relative to a point on the ground"
 We call this system the laboratory system
"In addition, we introduce a coordinate system located in the center of mass of thesystem of particles, as illustrated in Fig"
 13
10
 This system is called the center ofmass system
"The position of a particle i is ri in the laboratory system, and the position ofthe center of mass of the system is R in the laboratory system"
" The position ofparticle i in the center of mass system is rcm,i :ri = R + rcm,i , (13"
"52)Center of Mass in the Center of Mass SystemWhat is the center of mass of the particles measured in the center of mass system?The center of mass is:Rcm = 1M∑im i rcm,i = 1M(∑iri − ∑iR)= 1M∑iri − R = R − R = 0 "
(13
"53)418 13 Multiparticle SystemsNot surprisingly, the center of mass measured in the center of mass system, is in theorigin of the center of mass system"
 This was indeed the whole point of the centerof mass system
"Total Momentum in the Center of Mass SystemWhat is the total momentum, Pcm , of the system in the center of mass system? Thetotal momentum is defined as:Pcm = ∑im i vcm,i = ∑im iddt rcm,i = ddt∑im i rcm,i︸ ︷︷ ︸=MRcm=0= 0 "
 (13
54)The total momentum of the system in the center of mass system is always zero! Thisresult does not depend on the sum of external forces being zero
 This is always true
"Idenpendently of what is done to the system, it only depends on the definition of thecenter of mass"
13
5 Energy PartitioningWe can describe the motion of (the center of mass of) multiparticle systems usingthe concepts we developed in our studies of Newton’s laws of point particles
" Whatabout the concepts of mechanical energy we used to address the behavior of singleparticles, can we still use energy concepts for multi-particle systems?Kinetic Energy of a Multi-particle SystemWhat is the kinetic energy of a system of particles? The total kinetic energy is thesum of the kinetic energy of every particle in the system:K =N∑i=112 m (vi )2 =N∑i=112 m( dridt)2"
 (13
"55)Now, we want to divide the motion into the motion of the center of mass (the motionof the whole system), and the motion relative to the center of mass:ri = R + rcm,i , (13"
56)13
"5 Energy Partitioning 419and similarly for the velocities:vi = V + vcm,i "
 (13
"57)We use this to rewrite the total kinetic energy of the system, gettingK = 12 M (V)2 + 12N∑i=1m i(vcm,i)2 "
 (13
58)(You find a proof in Sect
 1
3)
" This shows that the total kinetic energy can be dividedinto two terms: The kinetic energy for the motion of the center of mass, the externalkinetic energy"
"Kcm = 12 MV2 , (13"
"59)and the kinetic energy due to the motion of the particles relative to the center of mass,which we call the internal kinetic energy:KΔcm = 12N∑i=1m i(vcm,i)2 "
 (13
"60)The total kinetic energy is therefore partitioned into a sum of the internal(KΔcm ) and external (Kcm ) kinetic energies:K = 12 MV2︸ ︷︷ ︸Kcm+ 12N∑i=1m i v2cm,i︸ ︷︷ ︸KΔcm"
 (13
"61)If the whole object is translated, as illustrated in Fig"
 13
"9a, there is no motion relativeto the center of mass"
 Then the total kinetic energy is simply the kinetic energy ofthe center of mass
 What we have done previously is therefore correct as long as weassume that the object is translated!But what if parts of the system are moving relative to the center of mass? Then wemust also include the internal kinetic energy: The energy related to the motion relativeto the center of mass
" For example, if a diatomic molecule is vibrating, we must alsoinclude the kinetic energy of the vibrating motion of the atoms"
 This means that fora system of particles we have more degrees of freedom—there are many possibleways that kinetic energy can be realized inside the system
" Hence, the kinetic energy420 13 Multiparticle Systemsof a system may be conserved, even though the kinetic energy of the center of massis not conserved"
"This means that we need a simplified way to describe the internal motion, themotion relative to the center of mass, of a particle system"
" For example, as we willsee later, for rigid bodies we do not allow vibrations or other deformations of theobject"
 The only motion possible relative to the center of mass is a rotation the wholebody
" In this case, we need to introduce a kinetic energy term related to the rotationof the body, and this is indeed one of the main focus areas when we discuss thedynamics of rigid bodies"
"Potential Energy of a Multi-particle SystemFor a multi-particle system, the kinetic energy is partitioned into the external andinternal kinetic energy"
" What about the potential energy of a multi-particle system?First, we need to be more precise"
 The potential energy related to what force? Therod in Fig
 13
"9 has a potential energy due to the gravitational force, which is the sumof the potential energy of every particle in the rod"
" But in addition, parts of the rod maybe compressed or stretched, and as a result the rod has an internal potential energyjust as a in a diatomic molecule"
" We therefore need to discern between externalpotential energy, the potential energy of an external force, and internal potentialenergy, the potential energy due to interactions within the system"
"Potential Energy Due to External ForcesIf a conservative external force acts on all the particles, we can describe the interactionthrough a potential energy, Ui (ri ), of particle i at position ri due to the external force"
The total potential energy of the system due to the external force is then:UTOT =N∑i=1Ui (ri ) 
 (13
"62)If the force is constant, such as for gravity near the Earth’s surface, this expressioncan be further simplified"
" In this case, the potential energy of particle i is:Ui (ri ) = m i gyi , (13"
"63)and the total potential energy is:UTOT =N∑i=1m i gyi = gN∑i=1m i yi = MgY , (13"
64)13
5 Energy Partitioning 421where Y is the Y -coordinate of the center of mass of the system
" We can therefore usethe well-known formula, U = mgy, also for the potential energy of a multiparticlesystem, we only need to use the center of mass position for y"
" Again, we find thatwe can use the concepts developed for point particles also for particle systems"
Notice that this conclusion is only true for a constant force
" For a force thatdepends on the position of each small part of the multi-particle system, the totalpotential energy cannot always be expressed as a function of the position of thecenter of mass alone"
 We may have to calculate the full sum (or integral) in (13
62)
But if the external force is approximately constant over the multi-particle system wemay approximate the potential energy by a function that depends only on the centerof mass position
"In addition, a multi-particle system may have internal degrees of freedom and acorresponding internal potential energy"
"Potential Energy Due to Internal ForcesThe net force acting on a particle i in a multi-particle system includes both externaland internal forces:Fneti = Fexti + ∑j =iF j,i , (13"
"65)where Fexti is the net external force acting on particle i, external here meaning thatit has its origin outside the system"
" The force F j,i from particle j on particle i is aninternal force"
"If all forces, external and internal, acting on the system are conservative, wecan introduce a potential energy for every force"
 The total potential energy of thesystem is the sum of all the potential energies for each of the forces
" We divide thetotal potential energy into the external potential energy, the potential energy due toexternal forces, and the internal potential energy, the potential enegy due to internalforces:UTOT = Uext + Uint "
 (13
66)The external potential energy was found in (13
62):Uext = ∑iUi (ri ) 
 (13
"67)The internal potential energy is a sum over all potential energies for all the interactionsin the system:Uint = ∑i< jUi, j(ri , r j) "
 (13
"68)422 13 Multiparticle SystemsNotice that we include a given interaction, a pair of particles i, j, only once in thissum! Here, we will not develop a general theory for this, but instead illustrate theprinciple by an example: The conservation of energy in a bouncing dumbbell asdiscussed in Sect"

"Conservation of Energy in a Multi-particle SystemIf all the forces, both internal and external, acting on a particle system are conserv-ative, the total mechanical energy of the system is conserved:ETOT = KTOT + UTOT , (13"
69)whereKTOT = Kcm + KΔcm 
 (13
"70)andUTOT = Uext + Uint , (13"
71)which gives:ETOT = Kcm + Uext + KΔcm + Uint 
 (13
"72)Based on this result we realize that in order to apply the principle of energy con-servation when solving problems in mechanics, we need to have expressions for thetwo terms KΔcm and Uint for the system"
" Unfortunately, these terms are not alwayssimple"
" For example, if you kick a football, the football will both rotate and wobbleduring its flight, as illustrated in Fig"
 13
11
" The kinetic and potential energy associ-ated with the wobbling represent internal degrees of freedom, and we do not knowhow to quantify these without a detailed model for the deformation of the football"
"For a detailed study of the motion of the football, energy concepts are therefore oflimited value as means for calculation"
" However, the energy concepts are still usefultheoretical techniques that provides us with concepts and methods to discuss theFig"

" In many cases, energy consideration are also the theoretical starting point,for example, for determining the deformation of the football"
"For a particular type of object, what we call a rigid body, we assume that theinternal deformation and the energies associated with these are negligible, and thatthe object moves a rigid body"
" In this case we neglect the internal potential energyof the system, but we still need to develop expressions for the kinetic energy of arotating rigid body"

" Particle Astarts on top and particle B starts on bottom, their positions are x A(t) and x B (t)respectively"
" We place particle B at a height h0 above the floor: x B (t0) = h0 , andparticle A is a distance b above particle B:x A(t0) = x B (t0) + b"
" When a particlehits the floor the collision is elastic, which means that the velocity of the particle isreversed after the collision"
Model: We find the motion of each particle from the forces acting on it
 Particle Ais affected by two forces: Gravity GA = −mg j and the spring force FA
" The springforce depends on the position of both particle A and B:FA = −k (x A − x B − b) j , (13"
"73)Similarly, the forces acting on particle B are GB = −mg j and FB :FB = −FA = k (x A − x B − b) j "
 (13
"74)Is it sufficient to study the motion of the center of mass alone? No, since we do nothave models for the external forces acting on the system, and we do not know whenor where they are acting without finding the motion of the individual particles"
 Thecenter of mass of the system is at:X = 1M∑ix i = 12m (mx A + mx B ) = 12 (x A + x B ) 
 (13
"75)Since the system collides with the wall when one of the particles hits the wall, andnot when the center of mass hits the wall (which it never will), we must find themotion of each particle individually"
"Newton’s second law: We apply Newton’s second law to each particle to find itsacceleration:aA = − km A(x A − x B − b) j , (13"
76)aB = km B(x A − x B − b) j 
 (13
77)where we also have to include a possible collision between particle B and the floor
Numerical solution: We determine the motion of the particles numerically usinga Euler-Cromer method
" We need to include all forces acting on each particle, andwe execute a collision step whenever particle B collides with the wall"
" When does acollision occur? Since we are determining the positions only at discrete time intervalsΔt, we do not expect the position of particle B ever to be exacly at the wall"
" Instead,the particle will be outside the wall at one time, t, and then inside the wall at a later13"

" We could try to improve our estimateof when the collision occurs, but here we will simply assume that the result of acollision is to reverse the velocity at the first time step the particle is “inside” thewall"
" The most important part of our collision algorithm is that is conserves energy,and this is indeed achieved by this method"
" Because the particle is not moved duringthe collision, the potential energy is conserved"
" And since only the direction of thevelocity is changed, the kinetic energy is conserved"

13 Illustration of the motion of the dumbbell
 Here we have illustrated the path of thecenter of mass (dashed line) and the path of each of the particles
" We have drawn in a system oftwo blocks and a spring to help your intuitionis affected by both gravity and the contact force, but between collisions, the systemis only affected by gravity"
" Consequently, we expect the center of mass to behave asa single object of mass 2m falling under the effect of gravity"
" That is, we expect:A = −g ⇒ X (t) = X0 + V0t − 12 gt2 , (13"
78)which is seen as the parabolically shaped motion of the center of mass in Fig
 13
13
"Even though the particles are oscillating back and forth, the center of mass does notdisplay any oscillations, but shows a smooth, parabolic shape (as a function of time)"
"Energy partitioning: We notice that after the second bounce, the center of massdoes not bounce up to its initial level even though the total energy in the system isconserved"
" If our system was a rigid ball, and the collision with the floor was elastic(and we neglected air resistance), we would expect the ball to bounce up to its initiallevel"
" Why do we expect this? Because at the top of the path, when X is maximum,the velocity is zero"
" For a rigid ball, this would also imply that the kinetic energyis zero, and that the total mechanical energy is equal to the potential energy, whichonly depends on the height"
" For the rigid ball, the height of each bounce must bethe same"
" But for the dumbbell system, there are also internal degrees of freedom"
"The kinetic energy is not zero at the top of the path, even though the velocity of thecenter of mass is zero, because the particles are still moving relative to the center ofmass"
" Similarly, the total potential energy is not only equal to the potential energy inthe external gravitational field, but also depends on the relative positions of the twoparticles"
We can use the concept of energy partitioning to analyze the behavior
" The totalkinetic energy consists of:K = Kcm + KΔcm , (13"

81)The kinetic energies are plotted in Fig

" Notice that before the bottom particlehits the floor, there is no relative motion, and the internal kinetic energy (KΔcm ) iszero"
 Each of the particles moves with the same velocity and the center of mass
" Imme-diately after the collision, the internal kinetic energy increases discontinuously—itjumps to a high level"
" What happened? After the collision, the velocity of the bot-tom particle is reversed"
 This has two effects
" First, the center of mass now has zerovelocity"
 But the magnitudes of the velocities of each of the particles are unchanged
The result is that each of the particles suddenly has a velocity relative to the centerof mass equal to the velocity they have before the collision
" As a result, there is ajump in the internal kinetic energy"
Another interesting observation is the oscillation in the internal kinetic energydue to the oscilliation of the particles around the center of mass

 A fine analysisof Figs

14 and 13
"15 shows that the internal kinetic and potential energies areoscillating with opposite phases—as we expect—so that when the internal kineticenergy is maximum, the potential energy is at its minimum and vice versa"
Discussion: From this example we learn that mechanical energy is conserved onlyif we include all the forms it may take
 The mechanical energy correspoding to thekinetic and potential energy of the center of mass is generally not conserved
 Inaddition we must take into account the many possible internal modes of motion andassociated potential energies
" However, if we simplify our system so that vibrationalmodes are not present, such as for a rigid body that does not deform, is it thensufficient only to use the kinetic and potential energy of the center of mass? No! Wehave looked at a too simple system! Real, two- and three-dimensional systems canbe rotated without deforming"
 We must therefore also include the effect of rotations
This is the subject of the next chapters

6 Energy Principle for Multi-particle Systems 42913
6 Energy Principle for Multi-particle SystemsThere are several ways to view energy conservation
" So far, we have mainly usedenergy conservation as a tool to determine the velocity of an object as a function ofposition"
" In this case, we include all external and internal conservative forces in thetotal energy of the object:ETOT = K cm + KΔcm + Uext + Uint , (13"
83)As a method for calculation this worked very well as long as we could ignore the inter-nal potentials and motion relative to the center of mass
" Fortunately, this reprensentsa whole class of problems, the motion of ridig bodies, where there are no internalvibrations and no internal potential energies, although the object may rotate, as wewill see further on"
 This approach is therefore a useful approach from a practicalpoint of view
"However, there is a different view on energy conservation which is very usefulfrom a theoretical point of view, while not that useful for direct calculations"
" Inthis view, we consider all conservative interactions to be internal interactions"
 Thisis done by including all the interacting objects in the system
" For example, if westudy the motion of a ball falling towards the Earth under gravity, we include boththe ball and the Earth in the system"
 The potential energy of the ball relative to theEarth is then an internal potential energy in a multi-particle system
" Similarly, wewould treat the solar system as a system consisting of all the objects in the solarsystem"
 We could also take a similar approach on an atomic scale
" Indeed, we couldconsider any object to consist of a large set of atoms, and since all the atoms interactthrough position-dependent forces, usually central forces, all the internal forces areconservative and the total energy of the system should be conserved"
" Unless thereare other, external forces acting on the system"
"Internal EnergyIf all the internal forces are conservative, the only way we can change the total energyof the system is by the work done by an external force"
" For a system of a book lyingon the floor, a system of the book and the Earth, we would increase the total energyof the system if we lifted the book by an external force"
 External work leads to achange in the total energy
 We often call the total energy of such a system the internalenergy of the system
 We write this as:Wext = ΔE 
 (13
"84)The work done by external force is the change in internal energy, ΔE"
" This formu-lation is call the first law of thermodynamics, and is considered a fundamental lawin physics"
"430 13 Multiparticle SystemsHow can we then interpret the work done by an internal force, such as the workdone by gravity in the system of the book and the Earth? In this case, the work done bygravity is given as a change in the internal potential energy of the book-Earth system"
"For example, if we release the book from a height h above the ground and the let itfall, the book has gained a kinetic energy correspondingn to the change in potentialenergy when book reaches the ground"
 This is not a change in the total energy
 Thereis no change in internal energy
 But it is an energy transfer between different formsof internal energy: It is an energy transfer from potential to kinetic energy inside thesystem
" Since we have assumed that all internal forces are conservative, all internalprocesses can be considered as transfers of energy"
The Arrow of TimeHmmm
" What about internal forces that are not conservative? How can we treat suchprocesses in this view? If we take the atomic view: All our systems consists of atomsand interatomic interactions are conservative, any system should therefore only haveconservative forces"
" Where does the non-conservative interactions come from? Forexample, if I take the book and slide it along an inclined surface from its initialheight h, there will also be a frictional force, and friction is not a conservative force"
"Is the total energy still conserved in the book-Earth system in this case? Yes! Whathappens is that as the book slides, the potential energy of the book-Earth system istransfered to kinetic energy of the book, as well as many internal kinetic and potentialenergies: The atoms in the book and the floor starts vibrating"
" This corresponds toan increase in the temperature of both book and Earth, which again correspondsto an increase in the internal energy"
" Thus, the total energy is conserved, but it isnow hidden in different internal energies inside the system"
" So why do we then callthe friction force conservative? Because it is conservative on a microscopic level:The total energy is conserved, but it is not conservative on a macroscopic level: Thefriction force depends on the relative velocities of the moving objects"
"This transfer of energy from macroscopic kinetic energy, the kinetic energy of asliding book, to microscopic kinetic and potential energies in the various vibrationsof the atoms, effectively introduces the arrow of time"
" If we release the book with aninitial velocity downward, it will slide down the slope and eventually come to rest"
 Thetotal internal energy of the system is conserved (if we ensure that it does not interactwith any external forces)
" It is then fully possible that the book instantaneously startsto slide upwards, back to its original position"
" If by accident the atomic vibrationsevery time pushed the book in the right direction, it could happen"
 None of theindividual processes would be against the laws of physics
 Such a processes wouldnot change the total energy of the system
 But it would be extremely unlikely
 Andthis is the reason why it is not happening
 And it is the reason why we laugh when weplay movies backwards

1 Rotational State—Angle of RotationHow can we describe the motion of the rod shown in Fig

" In this case, for a rodthrown across the room, the rod rotates around its center of mass"
" We can thereforeuse the center of mass, R(t), to describe the translational motion of the rod"
" This is agood choice, since the motion of the center of mass is determined from the externalforces acting on the rod—we could therefore find the motion of the center of massby solving the equations of motion"

1 The motion of a rotating rod thrown through the airforced to rotate around this attachment point
 The rotational configuration of the rodis often called the rotational state of the rod
 In order to uniquely define the rotationalstate of the rod we need to specify both the attachment point O and the angle θ therod forms with the horizontal
" But if we only specify the point O, we do not reallyknow how the object rotates around this point"
 We need to specify the rotationalaxis as well as a point on the axis
" For rotations in the x y-plane, we say that therotational axis is normal to this plane, that is, along the z-axis"
 This description holdsfor rotations in two dimensions
 We describe the three-dimensional case in Sect
 14
6
"In two dimensions, the rotational configuration of an object is described by:the angle θ; the point O it is rotating around; and the direction of the rotationalaxis, k"
How do we describe the positive rotational direction? This is customarily determinedby the right hand rule
 Figure 14
2 shows how the direction of the positive z-axisis determined from the directions of the x- and y-axes
 We can also use this rule14
1 Rotational State—Angle of Rotation 439Fig
 14
"2 Illustration of theright-hand rule xyzbackwards: Given the direction of an axis, such as the z-axis, we can find the positiverotational direction by pointing the right thumb in the direction of the axis: the positiverotational direction is then in the direction your remaining fingers are curling: fromthe x- towards the y-axis"
" In this direction θ increases, in the opposite direction theangle decreases"
"A Point on a Rotating ObjectGiven the angle θ and the rotation axis (including both a point on the axis and thepositive direction along the axis), we can unqiuely determine the orientation of arotating object"
 But how do we find the position of a particular point on a rotatingobject from this?Figure 14
3 shows the motion of a point P on an object rotating around a fixedaxis
 We describe the position of P using a coordinate system that rotates along withthe object
" The rotating coordinate system has to unit vectors that rotate with theobject: the unit vector ˆu r , which is directed radially outwards from the rotation axis,and an axis normal to the radial direction with unit vector ˆu n "
 A point on the rod canbe described in this coordinate system by:p = pr ˆu r + p n ˆu n 
 (14
1)When the object has rotated an angle θ both unit vectors have also rotated
" The radialunit vector now forms angle θ with the horizontal, and is given as:ˆu r = cos θ i + sin θ j , (14"
2)as illustrated in Fig
 14
3
" The normal vector, ˆu n , is obtained by rotating ˆu r 90◦ inthe positive direction:ˆu n = − sin θ i + cos θ j "

"3 Illustration of the unit vector ˆu P , and the position of the point P during rotation of a rodaround an axis through the originIf the object is rotating around a fixed axis, this gives the position of any point onthe object"
" If the object is rotating around a moving axis, such as the rotating rod inFig"
 14
"1, we also need to add the position of the axis—here given as the position ofthe center of mass:p = R + pr ˆu r + p n ˆu n "
 (14
4)The attentive reader may recognize the decomposition using the unit vector ˆu r andˆu n as polar-coordinates
 This is indeed correct
Rotational MotionWe can describe the rotational motion of the rod from Fig
 14
1 by a motion diagramfor the rod
 We have illustrated one such diagram in the bottom-right part of Fig
 14
"1,where we show the position of the rod at various times, ti , taken at constant timeintervals Δt"
" This plot looks like a movie of the motion of the rod, where all the imageshave been superimposed into one image"
" A better way to visualize the rotationalmotion of the rod is to plot the time evolution of the angle, θ(t)"
 Figure 14
4 showsθ(t) for the rotational motion in Fig

Test your understanding: Can you sketch two other motion diagrams for a rod that is rotating inthe negative direction and for a rod that is rotating faster and faster in the positive direction
 Sketchthe corresponding diagrams for θ(t)

" What happens when θ(t) increases beyond 2π? When θreaches 2π the rod has rotated a full revolution, and the rod is in the same positionas it was when θ was equal to 0"
 We cannot discern these positions: The position ofthe rod when θ = 2π is exactly the same as when θ = 0
" However, it is customaryto only use angles between 0 and 2π to describe the rotational position"
 This meansthat if the angle is larger than 2π we subtract 2π from the angle
 This is seen inFig
 14
"4: When the angle θ(t) reaches 2π, it continues at θ = 0"
" Similarly, whenthe angle decreases below 0, we add 2π to the angle, so that it continues at 2π"
" Youare, of course, free to choose to describe the motion using an angle θ that increasesalso beyond 2π, but then you have to remember that the motion is periodic so thathigher values does not represent new positions"
14
"2 Angular VelocityDuring rotation, the angle θ(t) changes with time"
" How can we characterize how fastthe rod rotates? By the angular velocity, which is defined as the rate of the change ofthe angle in analogy with the (translational) velocity, which is the rate of change ofthe position"
" During the time interval from t to t + Δt, the angle changes from θ(t)to θ(t + Δt)"
" We define the average angular velocity over the time Δt as:¯ω = θ(t + Δt) − θ(t)Δt = ΔθΔt , (14"
"5)When the time interval becomes small, we find the instantaneous angular velocityfor the rotational motion, which we in the following call the angular velocity:442 14 Rotational MotionAngular velocity:ω = limΔt→0ΔθΔt = dθdt = ˙θ "
 (14
6)Figure 14
"4 shows the angle, θ(t), and the angular velocity, ω(t) = dθ/dt for therotational motion in Fig"
 14
1
" Since the angular velocity is the time derivative of theangle, we interpret the angular velocity as the slope of the θ(t) curve (just as we didfor the translational velocity)"
 We see that the motions in Fig
 14
"1 has a constant,positive angular velocity"
"Test your understanding: Can you sketch θ(t) and ω(t) for a rod that is rotating equally fast inthe opposite direction?Velocity of a Point on a Rotating BodyAs the rod rotates, every part of the rod moves in a circle around the rotation axis"
"What is the velocity of a small part of the rotating rod, and how can we relate it tothe angular velocity? Let us address the motion of a small part, P, of the rotatingbody directly"
" We have illustrated its motion during a small time interval Δt, inFig"

"2 Angular Velocity 443time interval Δt, the rod has rotated an angle Δθ from the orientation θ(t) to thenew orientation θ(t + Δt) = θ(t) + Δθ"
 How far has P moved? It has moved the arclength Δs = RΔθ along its circular path
 The speed of the small part P is therefore:v = ΔsΔt = R ΔθΔt 
 (14
"7)If we let the time interval Δt become infinitesimally small, we find the speed of thepoint P to be:v = dsdt = ddt (R θ) = R dθdt = R ω "
 (14
"8)The speed of a point on the rod is therefore proportional to the angular velocity of therotation, but also proportional to the distance R to the rotational axis: Points furtheraway from the rotation axis rotate with higher speeds"
What is the direction of the velocity vector for P? Fig
 14
"5 shows that when thetime interval Δt becomes smaller, the change in angle Δθ also becomes smaller,and the direction of the displacement vector from P at time t to P at time t + Δtapproaches that of a tangent to the circle"
 Excatly the same result we found earlierwhen we studied circular motion
" The velocity vector is therefore parallel to thetangent to a circle of radius R, and points in the direction of the tangential unit vectorˆu T "
 The velocity of the point P is therefore:v = R ω ˆu T 
 (14
"9)Motion with Constant Angular VelocityIf an object rotates with a constant angular velocity, we can find the speed of the pointP from the distance traveled during one complete revolution, s = 2π R, divided bythe time of one revolution, call the period T :v = sT = 2π RT , (14"
10)where R is the distance from P to the rotation axis
" We also know that the velocityis v = Rω, therefore we find that:v = 2πT R = ωR ⇒ ω = 2πT "

"4 Comparing Linear and Rotational MotionWe have now introduced the angle θ, the angular velocity ω, and the angular accel-eration α used to describe the rotational motion of an object"
" Our definitions areclearly similar to the definitions we used to introduce position, x, velocity v, andacceleration a for linear motion, as illustrated in Table 14"
1
 Notice the analoguousform of these equations: They are identical from a mathematical point of view
" Itis only our physical interpretation, and therefore also the units, which are different"
The mathematical methods we use to determine motion are the same for linear androtational motion
 You can therefore use all the techniques you have developed tostudy linear motion also to address rotational motion

"5 Solving for the Rotational MotionThe structured problem-solving approach we developed for linear motion is alsoapplicable for rotational motion: We identify the quantities to be modeled; we modelthe system, resulting in a set of differential equations; we solve the differential equa-tions; and *analyze the results"
" We will see that for rotational motion, we usuallyneed to solve the equation of motion where the angular acceleration α is given:d2θdt2 = dωdt = α(t, θ, ω) , (14"
14)with initial conditions θ(t0) = θ0 and ω(t0) = ω0 
" You should realize that this isexactly the same equation we have solved over and over again for linear motion, onlywith different symbols (and interpretations) for the variables"
 You can therefore usethe machinery you have developed and are comfortable with from linear kinematics
You do not need to learn anything new!Analytical IntegrationFor a given α(t) we know how to solve to determine the motion: We solve by directintegration
 The angular velocity is the time integral of the angular acceleration:ω(t) − ω(t0) =∫ ωω0dω =∫ tt0dωdt dt =∫ tt0α(t) dt 
 (14
15)And the angle is the integral of the angular velocity:θ(t) − θ(t0) =∫ tt0ω(t) dt =∫ tt0(ω(t0) +∫ tt0α(t) dt)dt= ω(t0) (t − t0) +∫ tt0(∫ tt0α(t) dt)dt

17)θ(t) − θ(t0) =∫ tt0(ω(t0) + α0 (t − t0)) dt = ω(t0) (t − t0) + 12 α0 (t − t0)2 
(14
"18)Analytical SolutionIf the angular acceleration instead is a function of θ or ω, we cannot integrate, butmust instead solve the resulting differential equation"
" For example, if the angularacceleration is α = −Cω, and ω(0) = ω0 , then we must solve the equationdωdt = α = −Cω , ω(0) = ω0 "

" The solution to thisequation is on the form ω(t) = A exp(−Ct), where A is determined from the initialcondition: ω(0) = A = ω0 "

"Solve: We find the angle as a function of time by first integrating the angular accel-eration to find the angular velocity, and then integrating the angular velocity to findthe angle"

" What is the relationship between the angular acceleration of wheels A andB?Solution: First, we notice from the figure that the angular velocities must have oppo-site signs"
" Second, the condition that the two wheels are rotating without slidingmeans that their speeds at the point of contact must be equal, but oppositely directed"

 We will frequently use such condi-tions when we solve problems in mechanics
"For each of the wheels, the velocity at the point of contact is related to the angularvelocity by:v A = R AωA , v B = R B ωB "
 (14
"26)Since the velocities at the point of contact are equal and oppositely directed, we findthat the angular velocities also are related:v A = −v B ⇒ ωB = − R AR BωA "
 (14
27)This relation is general and does not requires the velocities to be constant
 We cantherefore find the angular accelerations by taking the time derivatives on each side:αB = ddt ωB = − ddtR AR BωA = − R AR BαA

"6 Rotational Motion in Three Dimensions 451is normal to the radius vector, r, and since it is in the x y-plane, the tangent is alsonormal to the unit vector in the z-direction"
 This allows us to write the velocity vectorof the point P as:v = ω k × r 
 (14
"30)This expression provides the correct magnitude and direction of the velocity vector: Itpoints in the positive rotational direction if ω is positive, and in the negative rotationaldirection if ω is negative"
 We can therefore introduce the angular velocity as a vector:ω = ω k (angular velocity vector) (14
"31)The angular velocity vector, ω, points along the axis of the rotation"
" For rotation inthe x y-plane, the rotation axis is the z-axis"
The expression in (14
"30) is valid not only for rotation in the x y-plane, but forany rotation around the axis given by the ω vector"
 This is illustrated in the right partof Fig

"8, where the velocity of a point at r going in a circular orbit around therotation axis is given by the radius of the circle, ρ, and the angular velocity, ω:vθ = ω ρ "
 (14
"32)We see from the geometry that the radius ρ is r sin(γ ), where γ is the angle betweenthe position vector, r and the angular velocity vector, ω"
 Thereforevθ = ω r sin(γ ) 
 (14
"33)The direction of the velocity is tangential to the circular orbit: orthogonal to theposition vector, r, and to the angular velocity vector, ω"
" This means that we can writethe velocity asv = ω × r , (14"

SummaryDescription of rotation:• The rotation of an object is described by the angle θ(t)• The angular velocity of the object is: ω(t) = dθ/dt• The angular acceleration of the object is: α(t) = dω/dt = d2/dt2 
Rotation and translation:• A point on the rotating body at a distance R from the rotational axis has a tangentialvelocity: v = R ω
Solving rotational motion:• We solve problems in rotations using the same structured approach as for linearmotion
"• In the “Solver” we solve the equation: d2θ/dt2 = α(t, θ, dθ/dt) with the initialconditions θ(t0) = θ0 and ω(t0) = ω0 "
"Numerical solution:• Numerically, we solve the equation using an iterative approach starting from theinitial conditions"
" For example, we can use Euler-Cromer’s method:ω(ti + Δt) = ω(ti ) + Δt α(θ(ti ), ω(ti ), ti )θ(ti + Δt) = θ(ti ) + Δt ω(ti + Δt)454 14 Rotational MotionAnalytical solution:• When the angular acceleration, α = α(t), is only a function of time, t, we cansolve the equations by direct integration:ω(t) = ω(t0) +∫ tt0α(t) dt , θ(t) = θ(t0) +∫ tt0ω(t) dt ,A typical example is motion with constant angular acceleration"
• For motion with constant angular velocity the solution is:θ(t) = θ(t0) + ω (t − t0) 
• For motion with constant angular acceleration the solution is:ω(t) = ω(t0) + α (t − t0)θ(t) = θ(t0) + ω(t0) (t − t0) + 12 α (t − t0)2 
"Rotational motion in three dimensions:• Generally, rotations occur around an axis, given by the angular velocity vector, ω"
• The velocity of a point on the rotating object at position r is: v = ω × r• The acceleration of a point on the rotating object at position r is: a = α × r + ω ×(ω × r)ExercisesDiscussion Questions14

" The general form ofNewton’s second law allows us to find the motion from our knowledge of forcesand force models for multi-particle systems, just as we have systematically donefor particle systems previously"
 We therefore have a well developed framework todetermine the motion of the center of mass
"But what about the internal motion of the system, the internal motion relative tothe center of mass? If you kick a football, it spins and wobbles on its path"
" How canwe determine the configuration of the football—how it is rotated and deformed ata particular point along its path? Unfortunately, we generally cannot determine theconfiguration without having a detailed model for the particle system"
 We need tomodel the internal motion of the various parts of the football to address its deformationand rotation
" Even in the simplest multi-particle system we can think of, the diatomicmolecule, energy is partitioned in a non-trivial manner, including both kinetic andpotential energy contributions for the deformation of the molecule"
"Fortunately, in many cases we can simplify the system significantly by assumingthat an object behaves as a rigid body that does not deform"
" A solid sphere, a stiff rod,a ball with little deformation, or a molecule with little internal deformation, may inmany cases be approximated as a rigid body—as a body without any internal defor-mation"
" This simplifies our description significantly: If the body does not deform,there are no internal energies associated with the deformation either"
 A rigid bodycan only be translated or rotated
 In this chapter we will introduce the kinetic andpotential energy of a rigid body
" We find that it depends on the rotational inertia of arigid body, called the moment of inertia"
 Rigid bodies with large moments of inertiarequire more energy to spin than rigid bodies with smaller moments of inertia
 Thisgives us the tools we need to apply energy considerations to systems with rotatingparts

1 Rigid BodiesA rigid body is a solid body that is not deformed
 What does this mean? It meansthat:The distance between any two points in a rigid body does not change
What possibilities does that leave us with?• We may translate the body
" If we move all the points by the same amount, wehave not changed the distanced between any points"
"• We may rotate the body, because any rotation does not deform the body—it onlychanges its orientation in space"
"A rigid body can have any shape, and it may also be a very simple object"
" For example,an object consisting of two point masses at a fixed distance d is a rigid body, and areasonable model for a diatomic molecule if the internal deformation is negligible"
"A rigid body is therefore a good approximation for a solid sphere, but not for a soapbubble"
15
"2 Kinetic Energy of a Rotating Rigid BodyFor a rigid body, we can find a simplified expression for the kinetic energy"
 Previously(see (13
"61)), we found that the kinetic energy of a body can be expressed as:K = 12 M V 2 +N∑i=112 m i v2cm,i , (15"
1)where the first term is related to the motion of the center of mass and describes thekinetic energy for the translational motion
 The second term is related to the motionrelative to the center of mass
" For a rigid body, the only way a part of the bodycan move relative to the center of mass is by rotation"
" We therefore interpret thesecond term as kinetic energy for the rotational motion, and we will here introducethe kinetic energy for rotating objects"
 An object can rotate either around a fixed axisor around a moving axis such as a moving center of mass
" Here, we first address thebehavior of a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis, and then generalize to the caseof an axis following the center of mass motion"

1 a A rod is rotating around an axis O through its center of mass
 b A rod is rotating aroundan axis P through another point P along the rodRotation Around a Fixed AxisThe rotation of an object around a fixed axis is illustrated by the motion of a rotatingrod in Fig
 15
1
" As we saw when we discussed rotations, the rod may rotate aroundan axis through its center of mass (the axis O in the figure), or it may rotate aroundan axis through some other point along the rod (the axis P in the figure)"
 These tworotations are clearly different
 It is therefore important to realize what we mean bya rotation around an axis: We mean that the object is rotating around a line
 A linecan be specified by a point and a vector
 It is not sufficient to specify the rotationby a vector alone
 In both cases in Fig
 15
1 the object is rotating with the angularvelocity ω
" The two axes are parallel, but they go through different points"
" You shouldtherefore always ensure that when you make a sketch of a rotating system, you clearlymark what point or what axis the object is rotating about"
"In order to determine the kinetic energy of the rigid body we assume that the bodyconsists of small mass-points with masses m i and positions, ri , where the positionsare measured relative to an origin placed on the rotation axis"
" The whole body isrotating with the angular velocity ω around the fixed axis through the origin, O"
" Weplace our coordinate system so that the z-axis points in the direction of ω: ω = ω k,What is the velocity of point i on the body? From our discussion of rotations, weknow that the velocity of a point on a rotating body at a position ri is:vi = ω × ri "
 (15
"2)We can simplify the description by decomposing the position into two vectors: thevector ρi , directed normal to the z-axis, and the vector z i k directed along the z-axisas illustrated in Fig"

" We choose ourcoordinate system so that theaxis O goes through theorigin and it parallel to thez-axisr iωOρiurzik yxUsing this expression, the velocity is:vi = ω k × (ρi + z i k) = ω k × ρi + ωz i k × k︸ ︷︷ ︸=0= ω k × ρi "
 (15
"4)We write:ρi = ρi ˆuρ , (15"
5)where ˆuρ is a unit vector pointing radially out from the axis to the point at ri 
" Thevelocity is therefore:vi = ωρi(k × ˆuρ)︸ ︷︷ ︸= ˆu T= ωρi ˆu T , (15"
6)where the unit vector ˆu T points in the tangential direction
"In order to find the kinetic energy, we only need the magnitude of the velocity foreach point:K =N∑i=112 m i v2i =N∑i=112 m i (ωρi )2 = 12( N∑i=1m i ρ2i)︸ ︷︷ ︸=I Oω2 , (15"
"7)where we have introduced the quantity I O , which we call the moment of inertia ofthe rigid body about the axis O:I O =N∑i=1m i ρ2i "
 (15
8)15
2 Kinetic Energy of a Rotating Rigid Body 461And we can write the kinetic energy for the rotating body as:Kinetic energy for rotation about the axis 0:K = 12 I O ω2 
 (15
9)Notice that the moment of inertia is a property of the object and the axis of rotation: Itdoes not depend on how the object rotates around this axis
 We interpret the momentof inertia as the rotational inertia of an object around an axis
" The rotational inertiatells us how difficult it is to spin an object: The larger the moment of inertia, thelarger energy is needed to obtain a certain angular velocity"
The expression K = (1/2)I O ω2 in (15
"9) is analogous to the expression for thetranslation kinetic energy for an object, K = (1/2)Mv2 "
" The mass M appears in oneequation, while I O , which involves both the mass and how it is distributed aroundan axis, occurs in the other"
Rotation Around an Axis Through the Center of MassFigure 15

 14
 In this case the object is subject toboth translational and rotational motion
 The kinetic energy of this object is givenby (15
"1) as:K = 12 M V 2 +N∑i=112 m i v2cm,i "
 (15
"10)If the rod is a rigid body, the only possible motion relative to the center of massis a rotational motion, as illustrated by the motion of the rod seen in the center ofmass system in the bottom right part of Fig"
 15
3
" We can then use exactly the sameargument we used above for rotation around a fixed axis, and find the kinetic energyfor rotation around an axis through the center of mass is:N∑i=112 m i v2cm,i = 12 I cm ω2 "
 (15
11)The total kinetic energy is therefore:K = 12 M V 2 + 12 I cm ω2

3 Calculating the Moment of InertiaThe moment of inertia around an axis O of a system of particles with masses m i atpositions ri is:The moment of inertia around an axis O: is defined asI O = ∑im i ρ2i 
 (15
13)where ρi is the distance from particle i to the axis O
"Notice that the moment of inertia is not only a property of the object, it also dependson the axis of rotation, and the moment of inertia of a given object around differentaxes may be different, as illustrated below"
" A common mistake is to forget that themoment of inertia depends both on the object and on the axis, and that the momentof inertia changes if we change the axis"

4 Illustration of a hammer where all the mass is located in the point P in the head of thehammer
" The hammer rotates around the point O, and the moment of inertia of a hammer dependson the distance R from the rotation axis to the hammer headThe moment of inertia depends on both the mass and how it is distributed aroundthe rotation axis"
 Figure 15
4 illustrates a hammer consisting of a heavy head of massM attached to an effectively massless rod
" (You can assume that all of the mass ofthe head is located in the marked point, P)"
" The moment of inertia of the hammer isI O = M R2 , (15"
"14)where R is the distance from the head, P, to the rotation axis O"
" We can thereforechange the moment of inertia by changing the mass of the head, or by changing thedistance from the head to the rotation axis"
" If you rotate it as a pendulum from yourhand this corresponds to changing your grip (point O), since this will change theposition of the rotation axis"
" As you move your grip closer to the head, the momentof inertia becomes smaller, and it becomes easier (requires less energy) to givethe hammer a certain angular velocity"
" Pulling mass in towards the axis of rotationreduces the moment of inertia, pushing it further out from the axis increases it"
"464 15 Rotation of Rigid BodiesSolid BodiesThe mass of the hammerhead is not really located in a point P, it is distributed inspace around this point"
 The moment of inertia of the hammerhead is therefore notzero even if the rotation axis is located at the center of the head
" To calculate themoment of inertia of a continuous body—a solid—such as the hammerhead, we mustsum all the contributions from a continuum of points corresponding to small volumeelements ΔVi with mass Δm i = ρM ΔVi , where ρM is the local mass density of thesolid"
" The sum over all points i in the solid becomes an integral when the size of aeach element goes to zero:I O = ∑iΔm i ρ2i = ∑iρM ΔVi ρ2i →∫ ∫ ∫ρM ρ2 d V , (15"
15)where the integral is over the solid body
 The moments of inertia around the centerof mass of various solid bodies are shown in Fig

5 Moments of inertia for various solid bodies15
"3 Calculating the Moment of Inertia 465The moment of inertia of a hammerhead of dimensions h × w × d (h is height, wis width, and d is depth) around its center O can be found from Fig"
 15
"5, where wesee that the moment of inertia of a plate around its center isI cm = 112 M(h2 + w2)"
 (15
16)This is therefore the real moment of inertia of the hammer when R = 0 m in theexample above
Parallel-Axis TheoremWe have now found a way to calculate the moment of inertia for a continuous objectsuch as the hammer
" But what if we now want to know the moment of inertia of thehammerhead for a different rotation axis—what if we want to know it as a function ofthe distance, R, from the center of the hammerhead to the rotation axis as illustratedin Fig"
 15
6?We could of course calculate the moment of inertia using the integral formulationin (15
15) for each position of the rotation axis
 But this is cumbersome
" Fortunately,it turns out that it is sufficient to calculate the moment of inertia around an axisthrough the center of mass"
" From this moment of inertia, we can find the moment ofinertia around any other parallel axis using the parallel-axis theorem:Parallel-axis theorem: The moment of inertia, I O , of an object around anaxis O is related to the moment of inertia, I cm , of the object around a parallelaxis through the center of mass of the object by:I O = I cm + Ms2 , (15"
"17)where M is the mass of the object, and s is the distance between the axis Oand the parallel axis through the center of mass"

 The moment of inertia around an axis C throughthe center of mass can be used to find the moment of inertia around an axis O—if the axis O isparallel to the axis C through the center of mass
" The vector s is perpendicular to both axes, andpoints from the origin of axis C to the origin of axis O(You can find a proof in Sect"

 The theorem is illustrated in Fig

 We canuse the parallel-axis theorem to find the moment of inertia around any axis if we onlyknow the moment of inertia around the center of mass
" This is why you usually onlyfind tabulated the moment of inertia of an object around its center of mass: Giventhis, you can use the parallel-axis theorem to find the moment of inertia for any otherparallel axis"
"We can use the parallel-axis theorem to find the moment of inertia of the hammeras a function of the distance R from the center of the hammerhead to the rotationaxis—it is simply given by:I O = I cm + M R2 , (15"
18)as long as the two rotation axes are parallel
 This allows us to calculate the momentof inertia for any R—as illustrated in Fig
 15

"Superposition PrincipleStill we are not satisfied with our characterization of the hammer, because it consistsof two pieces: hammerhead and shaft"
 So far we have assumed that the mass ofthe shaft is negligible and that we therefore can neglects its moment of inertia
"What if cannot neglect it—what to do then? We are saved by a principle calledthe superposition principle: For an object that consists of several parts, such as thehammerhead and the shaft of a hammer, we can find the moment of inertia aroundan axis by summing the moments of inertia for each part around the same axis:15"
"3 Calculating the Moment of Inertia 467The moment of inertia of two systems A and B round the axis O is the sum ofthe moments of inertia for each part of the systems:I O,AB = I O,A + I O,B "
 (15
19)(You can find a proof in Sect
 A
4)
 We can therefore find the moment of inertiaof a compound object by summing the moments of inertia for each of the object
 Justbe careful to ensure that you sum moments of inertia around the same axis
This allows us to find the moment of inertia of the hammer illustrated in Fig
 15
"6as the sum of the moment of inertia of the hammerhead and the shaft:I T OT,O = I h,O + I s,O , (15"
"20)where we have already found that the moment of inertia of the hammer is:I h,O = 112 M(h2 + w2)+ M R2 "
 (15
21)The moment of inertia of the shaft around the point O can be found just as for thehammerhead
 The moment of inertia around the center of mass for the shaft is foundfrom Fig

"5:I s,cm = 112 m L2 , (15"
"22)and we use the parallel-axis theorem to find its moment of inertia around point O,which is at a distance L/2 from the center of mass:I s,O = 112 m L2 + m( L2)2= 13 m L2 "
 (15
"23)The total moment of inertia of the hammer around the point O is therefore:I T OT,O = 112 m L2 + 112 M(h2 + w2)+ M R2 , (15"

4 Conservation of Energy for Rigid BodiesWe have found the kinetic energy of a rigid body that is either rotating around afixed axis or that is rotating around its moving center of mass
" If the solid body isonly affected by conservative forces, we may use energy conservation principles to470 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodiesdetermine the relation between angular velocity and position, just as we have donewith translational velocity and position previously"
" But in order to employ energyconservation, we need to determine the potential energy of a rigid body"
"Potential Energy for a Constant Gravitational ForceWhat is the potential energy for a rigid body due to the gravitational force? We foundthat for a point particle with mass m i at the position ri , the potential energy due to aconstant gravitational force directed along the y-axis is:Ui = m i gyi "
 (15
"33)We often call a constant gravitational force a homogeneous gravity, since gravityis the same everywhere"
" The total potential energy for multiparticle system of Nparticles is therefore:U =N∑i=1Ui =N∑i=1m i gyi = g ∑i=1m i yi︸ ︷︷ ︸=MY= M g Y , (15"
34)where Y is the position of the center of mass
" This result is general, and is also validfor a rigid body:Potential energy of a rigid body for a constant gravitational forceU = M g Y "
 (15
35)Potential Energy Due to a Spring ForceA rigid body may also be affected by a force modelled by a spring force
 This forcemay have several origins
 It may represent a contact force due to an elastic contact;a contact force due to a rope or string attachment; an approximation for a morecomplex force acting on a single part of the rigid body; or as a force acting on allparts of the rigid body
"First, we start from the simplest case, where a spring is acting on a particular pointon the rigid body"
 We illustate this situation by the contact between a sphere and anelastic floor for example while the rod is bouncing off the floor (see Fig
 15
10)
" Wecan then model the force from the floor on the sphere using a spring model, where15"

 15
10 Left Illustration of contact between a sphere and a surface
" Right Illustration of a rodthat can rotate around point O, but it is attached with a spring at point P"
" The other end of the springis attached at the point Qwe assume that the force depends on the position of a particular point, the point P,on the sphere"
" If the surface is horizontal at y = y f , the spring models a verticalnormal force from the floor:F = −k( p y − y f ) , (15"
"36)when the sphere is in contact with the floor, that is when p y < y f , where p y is thevertical position of the point P"
 The potential energy of the sphere due to this springforce is then:U ( p y ) = 12 k ( p y − y f)2 
 (15
"37)For the sphere, we see that the position of point P is related to the center of mass ofthe sphere, p y = Y − R, where Y is the vertical position of the center of mass, andR is the radius of the sphere"
"This result is not only valid for a sphere, but for another body affected by a springforce"
 The potential energy of a spring force is related to the elongation of the spring
We therefore need to relate the motion of the rigid body to the elongation of thespring by relating for example the position of the center of mass of the body or therotation angle θ of the body to the elongation of the spring
 This is illustration bythe rod on the right in Fig
 15
"10: The rod can rotate freely around the point O, butis affected by a spring attached to the rod at the point P and to the wall at the pointQ, so that when the rod is parallel to the wall, corresponding to θ = 0, the springis in its equilibrium position"
" The potential energy in the spring then depends on thedistance between P and Q, which for small rotation angles θ can be approximatedas ΔQ P  Rθ, where R is the distance from P to O"
 The potential energy due tothe spring force affecting the rotating rod is therefore:U s (θ) = 12 k (ΔQ P)2 = 12 k R2θ2 
 (15
"38)472 15 Rotation of Rigid BodiesIf the rod also is subject to gravity, we must also add the potential energy due togravity:U g (θ) = −Mg D sin θ , (15"
39)where D is the distance from O to the center of mass of the rod
 The total potentialenergy of the rod is then U = U s + U g 
"If you want to use a spring force model for a rigid body, you must thereforeconsider how to describe it in detail"
" We will introduce several ways to model suchinteractions in the following, but generally you are left to your own ingenuity"
"Conservation of Energy for a Rigid BodyHow can we now put the pieces together and use conservation of energy of a rigidbody relate its velocity (angular and translational) to its position (rotational andtranslational)? As long as the system is only subject to conservative forces, the totalenergy of a rigid body is:E = K + U = 12 M V 2 + 12 I cm ω2 + U "
 (15
40)For a rigid body the potential energy can only depend on the translational and rota-tional motion of the body and not on the internal deformation
 We have thereforeonly included one term for the potential energy: The potential energy due to externalforces
"If the object is rotating around a fixed axis—an axis that does not move—we cansimplify the kinetic energy, gettingE = 12 I O ω2 + U "
 (15
41)These two equations ((15
40) and (15
41)) forms the basis for using energy conser-vation to solve problems with rigid bodies

1 Example: Rotating RodProblem: Find the angular velocity for a rod that rotates without friction about anattachment point at one of its ends
 The rod starts in a horizontal position
 You canneglect air resistance
15
4 Conservation of Energy for Rigid Bodies 473Approach: We use an energy argument to relate the angular velocity of the rod to itsposition based on the kinetic energy of a rotating rigid body and the potential energyof a solid body affected by gravity
"Solution: How can we address this problem with what we have learned so far? Canwe use Newton’s laws of motion? Not really, because we do not know the forcesacting in the attachment point"
 Normal forces will be present in this point—but wedo not have a model to determine their magnitude
"What about energy conservation? We know how the kinetic energy of the roddepends on the angular velocity, and we know the potential energy of the rod inthe gravity field"
 But is the mechanical energy conserved in this case? There areno frictional forces and no air resistance
 The only external forces acting are thenormal force in the attachment point and gravity
" The force acting on the attachmentpoint does no work, because this point is not moving! And we know that the workdone by gravity can be expressed as a potential energy"
 We can therefore use energyconservation to solve this problem!Identify: We start from a sketch of the system in Fig
 15
11
 The rod has a length L
"Its position is given by the angle θ, and the rod starts at θ = 0"
 Our task is to find theangular velocity as a function of θ
" We choose a positive rotational direction, whichmeans that the angle θ in Fig"
 15
"11 is negative!Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy of a rigid rod rotating around the z-axis throughO is given as:K = 12 I z ω2 , (15"
42)where I z is the moment of inertia for the rod around the axis z through O
" For a rodrotating around a fixed axis, this is the only term for the kinetic energy"
"Caution: Notice that for an object rotating around a fixed axis you use the termK = (1/2)I ω2 for the kinetic energy, where ω is the angular velocity around thefixed axis"
 If you instead want to seperate the kinetic energy into the motion of theFig

 A frequent mistake is the confuse the two cases ofrotation around a fixed axis and rotation around the center of mass
Potential energy: From (15
"35) we found that the potential energy of a solid bodydue to gravity isU = M g Y , (15"
43)where Y is the vertical position of the center of mass of the object
" For a homogenousrod, the center of mass is located at its geometric center, that is at a distance L/2from the end"
 What is the vertical coordinate of this position? From Fig
 15
11 wesee that of the center of mass is:Y = L2 sin θ 
 (15
44)This is a negative number as long as θ is negative (and larger than −π)
 The potentialenergy of the rod is therefore:U = −Mg L2 sin θ 
 (15
"45)Solve: The total energy of the rod is conserved since all the forces are conservative(or not doing any work on the body), the total energy, E = K + U , is conserved"
"The total energy is therefore the same in the initial position, 0, when θ = θ0 = 0,and in the position 1, when the angle is θ:E0 = K0 + U0 = E1 = K1 + U1 , (15"
"46)whereE0 = K0 + U0 = 12 I z ω20 + MgY0 = 0 , (15"
47)andE1 = K1 + U1 = 12 I z ω21 + MgY1 = 12 I z ω2 − L2 Mg sin θ 
 (15
"48)Energy conservation, E0 = E1 , gives:12 I z ω2 − L2 Mg sin θ = 0 ⇒ 12 I z ω2 = L2 Mg sin θ ⇒ ω = ±√MgLI zsin θ ,(15"

"4 Conservation of Energy for Rigid Bodies 475where we get two solutions, a positive and a negative solution, depending which waythe rod is swinging"
" Both directions are possible solutions: For every angle θ the rodwill first swing one way, then swing the other way"
 Since there are no damping itwill continue swinging back and forth indefinitely
"Analyze: We have found a general solution, valid for the rotation of any type ofhomogeneous staff of length L"
 The solution depends on the moment of inertia forthe staff
" If the staff is slim, we know that the moment of inertia around the centerof mass is:Icm = 112 M L2 , (15"
"50)but the rod is not rotating around the center of mass, instead we need to find themoment of inertia around the end-point of the rod, that is, around the axis z"
" We usethe parallel-axis theorem to find this, since the rod is rotating around an axis parallelto an axis through the center of mass of the rod"
 The distance s from the center ofmass to the axis z in point O is L/2
 The parallel-axis theorem therefore gives:I z = Icm + Ms2 = 112 M L2 + M( L2)2= 13 M L2 
 (15
"51)For this rod, the angular velocity is:ω =√MgLI zsin θ =√ MgL13 M L2 sin θ =√3 gL sin θ "
 (15
"52)Test your understanding: How would your results change if the rod was not homogeneous, butinstead had all its mass located in a point at a distance L from the attachment point?15"
"5 Relating Rotational and Translational MotionFor a wheel rolling along a surface or for a rope running over a spinning wheel,the rotational and translational motion of the objects are related: If the wheel is toroll without slipping the center of the wheel must move a distance equal to the path“rolled out” by the wheel, and for the rope to run over the spinning wheel withoutslipping the length of rope pulled from the wheel must correspond to the length apoint on the wheel has moved (see Fig"

 How do we introduce such relationsbetween the rotation and the motion of the object?476 15 Rotation of Rigid BodiesFig

12 illustrates the motion of a wheel that is rolling withoutslipping
 What does this mean? That it is rolling wihtout slipping? It means that thedistance moved by the center of the wheel during a time interval Δt must correspondto the distance “rolled out”—the distance moved by a point on the surface of thewheel in the same time interval
" Alternatively, we could say that the point P onthe wheel that is in contact with the floor, does not move relative to the floor (seeFig"
 15
13)
 This point must therefore have zero velocity relative to the floor
 Let usfind an expression for the point P
 We do this by first finding the velocity of the pointxyp cmFig

"5 Relating Rotational and Translational Motion 477relative to the center of mass, and then adding the velocity of the center of mass tofind the velocity relative to the ground"
" In the center of mass system (a system withan origin that moves with the center of mass), the wheel is rotating around the origin"
"The velocity of P relative to the center of mass is therefore the velocity of a pointmoving in a circle around the origing with angular velocity ω:v P, cm = ω × pcm , (15"
53)where pcm is the position of point P relative to the center of mass
" If we place theorigin at the center of mass, we find thatpcm = −R j , (15"
54)as illustrated in Fig
 15
13
" The angular velocity is:ω = ω k , (15"
"55)and thereforevP,cm = ω k × (−R) j = ωR i "
 (15
"56)The velocity of point P relative to the ground is found by adding the velocity of thecenter of mass relative to the ground (using the Galilei-transformations):vP = vcm + P, cm = V + ωR i "
 (15
57)The wheel is rolling if this is zero:vP = V + ωRi = 0 ⇒ V = −ωR i 
 (15
58)Are the signs in this equation correct? Yes
" If Vx is positive we see that ω must benegative, as expected"
"Rolling condition: If the condition Vx = −ωR is satisfied, the wheel is rollingwithout slipping"
 This relation is called the rolling condition
" If this conditionis not satisfied, the contact between the wheel and the ground is moving relativeto the ground, and we say that the wheel is sliding"
 This condition is often usedto determine when a wheel starts rolling without sliding
Caution: A common mistake is to use the rolling condition also in the case when thewheel is slipping
 The rolling condition is only valid in the case of rolling withoutslipping

1 Example: Weight and Spinning WheelProblem: A weight of mass m is hanging from a massless rope that is wound arounda spinning wheel of mass M and radius R
 The spinning wheel can rotate withoutfriction around its attachment point at the center of the wheel
 The weight is releasedfrom rest
 Find the velocity v of the weight as a function of its height h
 You mayneglect air resistance
Approach: We plan to use energy conservation for the (wheel+weight) system
" Boththe wheel and the weight has a kinetic energy, but only the potential energy of theweight changes as it descends"
 The velocity of the weight and the angular velocityof the wheel is related because they are connected by the rope
 We solve to find howthe velocities depend on the position of the weight
"Solution: This problem may be addressed in several ways: We could apply Newton’slaws of motion, but then we need a law for rotational motion"
 We learn that inChap
" 16, and we return to this example then"
" The problem can also be addressedusing energy conservation—energy is conserved for the complete system consistingof the spinning wheel, the rope, and the weight since the only external forces aregravity, which is a conservative force, and the force acting at the attachment point ofthe spinning wheel—and this force does no work since the spinning wheel does notmove"
"Identify: The system consists of the weight, the rope, and the spinning wheel (seeFig"

" The weight of mass m has the position y and velocity v, with the positivedirection of y chosed upwards"
 The spinning wheel rotates with an angular velocityω around its attachment point at its center (of mass)
" Positive rotational direction ischosen according to the right hand rule, and is shown with the arrow indicating theangular velocity ω"
 The weight starts at the position y0 = 0 with the velocity v0 = 0
Model: Because all the external forces acting on the system are either conservative(gravity) or not performing any work (the normal force on the axis of the spinningFig

"5 Relating Rotational and Translational Motion 479wheel), we can use energy conservation"
" The total energy is E = K m + K W + U m +U w, where K m = (1/2)mv2 is the kinetic energy of the weight, K w = (1/2)I ω2 isthe kinetic energy of the spinning wheel, U m = mgy is the potential energy of theweight (where y < 0 since we assume the weight to start at y = 0), and U w = Mgywis the potential energy of the spinning wheel (which is constant since center of massof the spinning wheel is not moving)"
" Since the rope does not have any mass anddoes not stretch, we do not need to include the kinetic or potential energy of the rope"
"Solve: The total energy is calculated for two configurations: the initial configuration0 where the velocity of the weight is v0 = 0 and ω0 = 0, and the position 1 wherethe angular velocity of the spinning wheel is ω and the velocity of the weight is v:E0 = K m,0 + U m,0 + K w,0 + U w,0= 12 mv20 + mgy0 + 12 I ω20 + Mgyw= 0 + 0 + 0 + Mgyw , (15"
"59)andE1 = K m,1 + U m,1 + K M,1 + U M,1= 12 mv2 + mgy + 12 I ω2 + Mgyw "
 (15
60)These equations involve both v and ω
" However, the motions of the weight and thespinning wheel are related because they are connected by a massless rope"
" In orderfor the rope not to slip along the wheel, the rope must follow the motion of the wheelat point P"
 This means that the velocity of point P on the wheel must be the sameas the velocity of the rope at this point:vP = ω × r = ω k × (−R i) = −ω R j 
 (15
"61)In order for the rope to remain tight and not stretch, the velocity of the rope at pointP must be the same as the velocity of the weight"
" We therefore have:vP = −ωR j = v , (15"
62)which is the velocity of the weight
 We insert v = −ωR into (15

"66)where we have chosen the negative solution for v, since we know that the weight ismoving downwards"
 We recall that y is negative since the weight is falling down
"Analyze: Let us test this result by checking what happens when the spinning wheelis massless, that is when M  m"
" In this limit we find v = √2g(−y), which isthe result we expected"
" Since the velocity of the weight for finite masses of thespinning wheel is smaller than this, the effect of the spinning wheel is to slow downthe acceleration of the weight"

" Various symmetrical, roundobjects of mass M, radius R, and moment of inertia I about an axis through thecenter of mass, are rolled down a hill of vertical height h"
 Find the velocity v of theobject at the end of the hill
 You may neglect the effects of air resistance
Approach: We plan to use energy conservation: The initial potential energy is con-verted to translational and rotational energy of the object
 The rolling conditionrelates translational and rotational motion
Solution: We may use the conservation of total mechanical energy if all the forcesare conservative
" A rolling object is affected by gravity, which is conservative, by thenormal force, which does no work, and by a friction force from the surface"
" What,you say, friction? How can we then use energy conservation? It turns out that for anobject that is rolling without slipping, the friction force acts in the point of contactbetween the rolling object and the surface, and the velocity of this point is zero"
 Thework done by the friction force on the object is therefore zero:W =∫ t1t0F · v dt = 0

 The object starts at Y0 with the velocity V0 = 0 and theangular velocity ω0 = 0
" What is the velocity (of the center of mass) at Y = Y1 =Y0 − h?Model: The total energy of the object is E = K T + K R + U , where K T =(1/2)M V 2 is the translational kinetic energy, related to the motion of the center ofmass, and K R = (1/2)I ω2 is the rotational kinetic energy, related to the motionrelative to the center of mass"
 The potential energy is due to gravity U = MgY 
Solve: Conservation of energy gives:E0 = E112 M V 20 + 12 I ω20 + MgY0 = 12 M V 2 + 12 I ω2 + MgY10 + 0 + MgY0 = 12 M V 2 + 12 I ω2 + MgY1Mg (Y0 − Y1)︸ ︷︷ ︸=h= 12 M V 2 + 12 I ω2

68)We relate the translational and rotational motion using the rolling condition
" As longas the object is rolling without slipping:V = Rω ⇒ ω = V /R , (15"

70)482 15 Rotation of Rigid BodiesAnalyze: The result depends on the ratio I /M R2 
" Let us introduce the number c forthis:c = IM R2 , (15"
71)The number c characterizes how the mass is distributed around the center of mass
Large values of c means that the mass is placed far from the center of mass
" As moremass is pulled towards the center of mass, c is reduced"
 We can find c for variousordinary shapes
" For a cylinder shell c = 1, for a cylinder c = 1/2, and for a spherec = 2/5"
 We interpret c = 0 as the case where a block is sliding without rolling ona frictionless surface
" We can find the velocity V expressed using c:gh = 12 V 2 (1 + c) , (15"
72)V =√ 2gh1 + c 
 (15
"73)We see that smaller c gives larger velocities, and the object with the largest velocitywins the race"
 Hence the object with the smallest value of c would win
" Notice thatthe results do not depend on the mass, only on how the mass is distributed aroundthe axis of rotation"
"Test your understanding: How would you construct a rolling object with a small value of c?SummaryA rigid body: A rigid body can be translated or rotated, but the distance betweenany two points in the body does not change"
"Moment of inertia:• The moment of inertia of a multiparticle system around an axis O is: I O =∑i m i ρ2i , where m i is the mass of particle i, and ρi is the distance from par-ticle i to the rotation axis O"
"• The moment of inertia of a solid body with mass density ρM around an axis O is:I O = ∫∫∫ ρM ρ2 d V , where ρ is the distance from the element d V to the axis O"
"• Moments of inertia are added according to the superposition principle: Themoment of inertial of two systems A and B around the axis O is the sum ofthe moments of inertia for each of the systems: I O,AB = I O,A + I O,B• The Parallel-axis theorem: The moment of inertia I O of an object around an axisO can be found from the moment of inertia of the object around an parallel axisthrough the center of mass of the object, Icm : I O = Icm + Ms2 , where s is thedistance between the axis O and the center of mass"

"• The potential energy of a rigid body in a homogeneous gravity field is: U =MgY , where Y is the vertical position of the center of mass of the system"
"Relating translational and rotational motion:• For two objects connected by a thin, non-elastic rope, the point of contact with therope must have the same speeds for both objects"
• An object is rolling without slipping along a surface if the point in contact withthe surface has zero velocity relative to the surface

11 Micro-electromechanical system
" In this project you will learn about themoment of inertia, and the potential and kinetic energy of a rotating object, and wewill use this to study a simple electromechanical system, similar to a micro-mirrorused in most modern projectors"
Modern production techniques for microscopic systems allows us to constructsmall mechanical elements made of silicon
" For example, we can construct smallsilicon cantilevers with dimensions down to a few micrometers"
" In this project wewill address the motion of a thin, microscopic beam using energy techniques"
"First, let us consider a small, square mechanical element of dimensions L × L × hand mass M"
 We assume that the thickness h is so small that we can neglect the finitethickness of the square
 The square is attached with a hinge at one of the ends oflength L

"(e) Show that the moment of inertia, I y for the whole object is I y = (22/3) M L2 "
 Hint1: You can calculate the moment of inertia for each part of the object independentlyand sum the results
 (This is called the superposition principle)
 Hint 2: Use theparallel-axis theorem to find the moment of inertial around the y-axis for each partof the object
"Even though we are considering a microscopic system, where the effect of gravitytypically will be negligible, let us first consider the motion of the cantilever when it isaffected by gravity"
 For a real microscopic cantilever the effects of electrostatic forcesis typically more important
 Often such interactions results in a constant electrostaticforce on the cantilever
 The results from studying the behavior of the cantilever whenaffected by gravity as we do here can therefore easily be translated into the behaviorof a cantilever affected by electrostatic forces
The gravitational force acts in the negative z-direction
" As a result of gravity, thecantilever rotates and angle θ around the y-axis as illustrated in Fig"

21
"(f) Show that the potential energy of the cantilever due to the gravitational forceis U G = −5M Lg sin θ, where the potential energy is zero when the cantilever ishorizontal"
(g) Assume that the cantilever starts with an initial angular velocity ω0 = 0 whenθ = 0
" Find the angular velocity of the cantilever, ω(θ), when it has reached theangle θ"
"In the following, we will no longer assume that the cantilever rotates freely aroundthe y-axis"
" Instead, we will assume that it bends around a hinge along the y-axis, and488 15 Rotation of Rigid Bodiesthat the bending is like the bending of an elastic body"
 This means that there is anpotential energy associated with the bending
 The potential energy of the cantileverwhen it is bent an angle θ due to the stiffness of the hinge is U h = (1/2) κ θ2 whereκ is a constant that depends on the material properties (and the size) of the hinge
"(h) Again, assume that the cantilever starts with an initial angular velocity ω0 = 0when θ = 0"
" Find the angular velocity of the cantilever, ω(θ), when it has reachedthe angle θ"
(i) Describe the motion of the cantilever
For small θ we can approximate sin θ  θ
 We will use this approximation in thefollowing
(j) Find the maximum angle θ of the cantilever when it is released as described above
(k) Draw an energy diagram in the form of the total potential energy of the cantileveras a function of θ
 Can you find any equilibrium points for the cantilever?Small cantilevers are used for many technological applications
" For example, pro-jectors using the DLP technlogy consists of a vast number of micromirrors, smallcantilevers that reflect light"
" When an electrical field is applied to the cantilever, thecantilever is affected by an electrostatic force"
" We can describe this in the same wayas we described gravity above, but the electrical field can be turned on or off"
" As aresult, the cantilever can be bent, and the light is reflected in a different direction"
 Youcan look at other interesting applications by searching for MEMS in your favouritesearch engine
Chapter 16Dynamics of Rigid BodiesHow do you spin a ball? And how do you jump-spin on skates? In this chapteryou learn what causes changes in rotational motion using Newton’s second law forrotational motion
"You know how to describe the rotation of a wheel around a fixed or moving axis,using the angle, the angular velocity, and the angular acceleration of the wheel"
 Andyou know how to find the kinetic energy of a rotating rigid body
" But what causeschanges in rotational motion? For translational motion we can use Newton’s secondlaw to determine the change in the translational state, in the translational momentum,from the external forces acting on a body"
" We use this both to find the accelerationof a body, and from the acceleration we can calculate the motion, and to find conser-vation laws for the translational momentum"
 Can we find a similar law for rotationalmotion? In this chapter we will introduce the rotational analogue to translationalmomentum: rotational momentum or angular momentum; the rotational analogue toforce: torque; and the rotational analogue to Newton’s second law: Newton’s secondlaw for rotational motion
" Armed with these tools you will see that you are readyto solve any problem of moving and rotating rigid bodies, such as figuring out whatcauses a ball to spin or how you jump-spin on skates"

1 Motivating Example—Spinning a WheelIncreasing the Angular Velocity of a Spinning WheelFigure 16
"1 shows how a wheel is spun by a force F applied to a pedal, which isattached to a lever, which again is attached to the wheel"
 The wheel accelerates—itincreases its angular velocity from ω0 = 0 rad/s to ω as the wheel rotates an angle θ
We can find the angular velocity ω as a function of θ from the work-energy theorem

1 We spin up a bicycle wheel by applying a force F of constant magnitude to an armattached to the axis of the wheel
" The wheel rotates around a fixed axis at its center, and the distancefrom the axis to the point where the force is applied is RW =∫ tt0F · v dt , (16"
"1)where v is the velocity of the point where the force is acting, that is, the velocity ofthe pedal"
" The pedal rotates around a fixed axis, the axis of the wheel, and thereforemoves in the tangential direction:v = v ˆu T "
 (16
"2)We can similarly decompose the force in the tangential and normal directionF = FT ˆu T + F N ˆu N , (16"
3)as illustrated in Fig
 16
1
 It is only the tangential component that contributes to thework
 The normal component does no work since there is no motion in this direction
"If we apply a constant tangential force, FT , and this is the only force acting, the work-energy theorem gives:W = FT s = FT Rθ = K1 − K0 , (16"
4)where the distance s = Rθ moved by the pedal depends on the distance R from therotation axis to the point where the force is acting
" The change in kinetic energy ofthe rotating wheel is:K1 − K0 = 12 I ω2 − 12 I ω20 , (16"
5)16
1 Motivating Example—Spinning a Wheel 491If we insert this into (16
"4) and assume that we start from rest, ω0 = 0, we get:FT Rθ = 12 I ω2 ⇒ ω2 = 2FT R θI "
 (16
"6)How does this compare with our intuition? We see that the rotational inertia, I ,plays an important role: If we increase I but keep everything else fixed, the resultingangular velocity gets smaller: It becomes more difficult to get the wheel started if Iis larger"
"In addition, the angular velocity depends on how large the force FT is and howfar, R, from the rotation axis it is applied"
" First, we notice again what we alreadyobserved: It is only the tangential component of F that matters: We cannot acceleratethe rotation of the rod by pulling at it in the radial direction"
" Second, we see that it isthe combination τ = FT R that matters"
 This combination is often called the torqueof the force F
 We can therefore increase the final angular velocity by increasing theforce FT or by increasing the distance R from the axis where the force is applied
Angular Acceleration of a Spinning WheelCan we use this approach to find the angular acceleration? Yes! By applying themethod to a very short time interval
" As the interval becomes smaller and smaller,we effectively introduce the time derivative of both sides of (16"
4)
 For the rotationalsystem in Fig
 16
"1, the work done by the constant, tangential force FT isW = FT RΔθ = 12 I ω2(t + Δt) − 12 I ω2(t) "
 (16
7)when the wheel rotates an angle Δθ during the short time interval Δt
" We divide byΔt on both sides:FT R ΔθΔt =12 I ω2(t + Δt) − 12 I ω2(t)Δt , (16"
"8)This becomes the time derivative as Δt becomes small:FT R dθdt = ddt( 12 I ω2)= I ω dωdt , (16"
9)where we have applied the chain rule and assumed that I is constant
" Finally, bydividing by ω on both sides:FT R = I dωdt = I α = ddt I ω , (16"
10)492 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodieswe have found the angular acceleration! This equation looks very much like Newton’second law for translational motion:F = m dvdt = ma = ddt mv 
 (16
"11)For rotational motion, we replace:The force by the torque F → FT RThe translational inertia (mass) by the rotational inertia m → IThe acceleration by the angular acceleration a → α(We can derive Newton’s second law from the work-energy theorem in exactly thesame way"
) Equation (16
10) is indeed Newton’s second law for rotational motion
"This law is general, even though it was here derived for a special situation"
Interpreting Newton’s Second Law for RotationsFrom Newton’s second law for rotational motion in (16
"10), we interpret the torqueR FT = τ as the cause of the angular acceleration, just as we interpreted the force asthe cause of acceleration for translational motion"
 We see that I plays the role of arotational inertia
" For a given torque, τ = FT R, a larger value of I means a smallerangular acceleration"
" Also, we see that the torque τ = FT R depends on both thetangential force, FT and the distance to the rotation axis, R: If we apply the sameforce F further out from the rotation axis, we get a larger torque and a larger angularacceleration"
The top figures in Fig
 16
2 illustrates how we must increase the force as thedistance R changes in order to keep the same torque and therefore the same angularacceleration: If we increase R we have to decrease FT by the same factor to keep theacceleration the same
" This is illustrated in the figure, where we have shown arms oflength R/2, R and 2R and the corresponding forces, 2F, F, and F/2"
The bottom figures in Fig
 16
"2 shows what happens when we keep the torque thesame, but change the moment of inertia"
" If we assume that the mass is concentrated intwo weights attached to a thin rod, the moment of inertia is I = 2Mr2 , where r is thedistance from the center of the rod to the center of each of the masses"
 From Newton’ssecond law for rotational motion in (16
"10), we find the angular acceleration:α = FT RI "
 (16
"12)If the torque, FT R is constant, the acceleration depends inversely on I "
 We illustratethis by showing the orientations of the object at three subsequent (but not equallyspaced) timesteps
 All these systems have the same mass
 It is how the mass is distrib-uted around the rotation axis that matters
" And as evident, changing the distributionhas a significant effect on the acceleration"
16

 16
"2 Top All three wheels have the same torque, τ = FT r, where r is the distance from the axisto where the force acts, and FT is the tangential component of the force"
 Bottom The same torqueis applied to three systems with different moment of inertia—changed by moving the positions ofthe masses
" The position of the object are shown at four times, t0 , t1 , t2 = √2t1 and t3 = √3t1 ,which are the same for all systems: The differenced are due to differences in angular accelerationdue to differences in the moment of inertiaWhile Newton’s second law for rotational motion was introduced in the specialsituation of a constant force, we will in the rest of this chapter see that the law isgeneral, and you will learn how to apply it to determine the rotational motion of asystem"
16
"2 Newton’s Second Law for Rotational MotionIn the introductory example we introduced the following law for the rotational motionof an object subject to a single, constant force:τ = FT R = I α , (16"
13)where τ = FT R is called the torque for the force F
 The torque depends only on thetangential component of F
" This is the component that is normal to the vector fromthe rotation axis to the point where the force acts, r, as illustrated in Fig"

3 Illustration of howthe torque of the force F iscalculated: Only thetangential component FTcontributesF TF N Fru Nu Txyφmay recall to have seen this before
 We recognize the torque as the magnitude of thecross product between r and F
 This is easily seen by decomposing r and F in thenormal (radial) and tangential directions: r = r ˆu N and F = FT ˆu T + F N ˆu N 
" Thecross product is then:r × F = r ˆu N × FT ˆu T + r ˆu N × F N ˆu N = r FT k , (16"
"14)where ˆu N × ˆu N = 0, and ˆu N × ˆu T = k is a unit vector that point out of the plane,in the z-direction"
" This allows a more general definition of the (vector) torque of theforce F around the point O:Definition of torque:τ O = r × F , (16"
15)where r is the vector from O to the point where F is acting
"The torque, FT R, in (16"
13) is therefore the z-component of the vector torque:τz = FT R = I α 
 (16
"16)In the introductory example we discussed the effect of a single force, producinga single torque"
" However, an object may be subject to several forces, all acting inseparate points, giving rise to separate torques"
 The work-energy theorem used inthe example depends on the net force
 Hence we must insist on using the net torquewhen formulating Newton’s second law for rotational motion
" 11 Notice that the torque τ points in the z-direction, which is also the direction of the rotationvector, ω = ω k"
 This suggests a vector formulation of Newton’s second law for rotational motion:∑ τ j = I α
" Unfortunately, this is generally not correct"
 We will return to a vector formulationlater

"2 Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion 495Newton’s second law for rotational motion (N2Lr): for a rigid body rotatingaround a fixed axis (the z-axis) is:∑jτz, j = τ netz = I z αz , (16"
"17)where τ j = r j × F j is the torque of force j, r j is the position of the pointwhere force j is applied, and I z is the moment of inertia (the rotational inertia)of the object around the rotation axis"
"Structured Problem-Solving ApproachThis law allows us to determine the rotational motion of a rigid body, just like wepreviously have found the translational motion of an object using Newton’s secondlaw"
" We can follow the same structured problem-solving approach as we used fortranslational motion, but with some modifications as illustrated in Fig"

"There are a few, but important differences between how we address problemswith translational and rotational motion"
" When we identify the relevant systems andvariables for rotational motion around a fixed axis, we must of course describe theconfiguration of the object using the angle θ and the angular velocity ω"
" When wemodel the system, we still start from a free-body diagram of the rotating object, butwe must now carefully specify the rotation axis and where each of the forces areacting, because this is essential in order to calculate the torque"

2 Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion 497• The torque is given as a cross product: The torque is therefore normal to boththe position vector rand the force F
 We find the direction of the torque using theright-hand rule
"• For a two-dimensional system in the x y-plane, the torque is always directed alongthe z-axis"
 We often use the z-component τz of the torque instead of the full vectornotation for the torque
 The sign of τz indicates if the torque is in the positive ornegative z-direction
"• The direction of the torque is normal to the position and force vectors, and itsmagnitude is:|τ | = |F| |r| sin φ , (16"
19)where φ is the angle between the position vector r and the force vector F asillustrated in Fig

"• If the force is parallel to the position vector, the torque is always zero for this force"
"For example, for a weight in a rope whirled in a circular path, the torque of therope tension around the center of the path is always zero, since the rope tensionacts in the direction of the position vector"
" Similarly, the torque of the gravitationalforce from the Sun on the Earth (taken around the Sun) is also always zero"
"• If the position vector r is zero, that is, if the force acts in the origin, the torque ofthe force is zero"
" This is commonly used “trick” to solve problems: If we placethe origin at a force we do not know, its torque is zero independently of the force"
• Torques obey the superposition principle
 The total torques of a force F1 actingat the point r1 and the force F2 acting at the point r2 is:τ = τ 1 + τ 2 = r1 × F1 + r2 × F2 
 (16
"20)Notice that you can only add torques that all are taken around the same point!• To calculate the torque of a the gravitational force acting on a rigid body (whengravity is a constant) you assume that the total gravitational force acts in the centerof mass:τ = R × Mg , (16"
21)where R is the position of the center of mass
 This is found by summing all thetorques acting on each small element i of the rigid body:τ = ∑iri × m i g =(∑im i ri)× g = MR × g = R × Mg

"6a illustrates a force F applied to a wrench, at a point r relative to therotation axis, which is placed in the origin"
" While we can always find the torquedirectly fromτ = r × F , (16"
23)if we know r and F
" However, it is often practical to decompose either the force For the arm, r, in order to simplify the calculation of the torque"
"If you decompose the force, F into a component Fr = Fr ˆu r in the direction alongr and a component Fn = Fn ˆu n in the direction normal to r, the torque isτ = r × F = r × (Fr ˆu r + Fn ˆu n) = r × Fr ˆu r + r × Fn ˆu n = r Fn k "
 (16
24)since the force component along r does not contribute to the torque - it is only thecomponent of F normal to the arm that contributes
"Alternatively, you could decompose the arm r into a component rF = r F ˆu F inthe direction along F, and a component rN = r N ˆu N in the direction normal to F asillustrated in Fig"
 16
6b
" The torque is then:τ = r × F = (r F ˆu F + r N ˆu N) × F = r N F˛, (16"
25)which shows that it is only the component of the arm that is normal to the force thatcontributes to the torque

2 Example: Pulling at a WheelProblem: A force F is applied tangentially at the rim of a wheel made of a homoge-neous cylinder of mass M and radius R
" (You may think of this as pulling at a ropewith a constant force, where the rope is wrapped around the wheel and unwinds asyou pull)"
 The wheel starts at rest and is attached to a frictionless axis at its center
Find the angle θ of the wheel as a function of time
"Approach: We use Newton’s second law for rotational motion since the wheel rotatesaround a fixed axis: We find the forces and where they are acting, then we find thetorques, calculate the angular acceleration, and integrate to find the motion"
"Identify: The rotational position of the wheel is described by the angle θ, withpositive direction shown in Fig"

 The wheel starts at θ0 = 0 with angular velocityω0 = 0 at t0 = 0
"Model: The external forces acting on the wheel are: gravity, G, acting in rG = 0 atthe center of mass of the wheel; the contact force N from the axis on the wheel actingin rN = 0 at the axis (notice that N has to balance the two other forces, becausethe center of mass of the wheel does not move), and the force F = −F i, acting atrF = R j at the rim of the wheel"
"The torques of both gravity and the normal force are zero, since rG and rN arezero"
" The torque of F around O is:τ F = rF × F = R j × −F i = R F k , (16"
26)which is the net torque around the origin
" The z-component, the component alongthe rotation axis, is τz = R F"
" Newton’s second law for rotatational motion around afixed axis gives:τ netz = R F = I z α , (16"

3 Example: Blowing at a PendulumProblem: A pendulum consists of a sphere of radius R and mass M
" The centerof the sphere is attached at the end of a thin, massless rod of length L"
" The otherend revolves around a bolt, providing a fixed, friction-free axis for the pendulum"
"The sphere is affected by air resistance, which you for simplicity can assume to actat the center of the sphere"
 You can use a quadratic law for the air drag
" Developa method to find the motion of the pendulum when affected by a horizontal wind,w(t) = w(t) i, which may vary in time, and explore the behavior of the pendulumfor various types of winds"
Approach: The pendulum is rotating around a fixed axis
" We can therefore solve theproblem using Newton’s second law for rotational motion: From the forces actingwe introduce force models, find the torques, find the angular acceleration from thenet torque, and solve to find the motion"
"Identify: We measure the position of the pendulum by the angle, θ, with the verticalas shown in Fig"

" We need to define initial conditions for the motion, and assumethat the pendulum starts at θ0 = 0 and with initial angular velocity ω(t0) = ω0 att0 = 0 s"

 The pendulum is affected by gravity G = −Mg j

" The gravitational force is therefore drawn inthe center of the sphere, at rG = r, where r is a vector pointing from the rotationaxis O to the center of the sphere"
"From the figure, we see thatr = L sin θ i − L cos θ j "
 (16
"31)The torque of gravity is:τ G = r × G , (16"
32)which we find by inserting the vector for G and r:τ G = (L sin θ i − L cos θ j) × −Mg j = −MgL sin θ k 
 (16
"33)The air resistance, FD = −D|v − w|(v − w), also acts at the center of the sphere,rD = r"
" Here, v is the velocity of the center of the sphere and w is the velocity of theair"
" When there is no wind, w = 0, and the air resistance reduces to the well knowform, FD = −Dvv"
 What is v? We can find the velocity of any point on a rotatingrigid body using v = ω × r
" The torque of FD is:τ D = rD × FD , (16"
34)where rD = r
" For the general case where an external wind w is applied, we need tocalculate this based on the wind"
" However, it is useful to see that we get a simplifiedresult when w = 0 and FD consequently is directed along v"
 Thenτ D = r × −Dvv 
 (16
"35)Because r is normal to v, we get r × v = Lv k"
 (Ensure you get the same by applyingthe right-hand rule)
" If we insert v = ωL we get502 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodiesτz,D = −DL3|ω|ω "
 (16
36)This expression also ensures that we get the right sign for the torque both whenω > 0 and when ω > 0
" Check that you also get this!The pendulum is also affected by a contact force, N, from the attachment bolt"
"In reality, the contact force is distributed along the contact between the bolt and therod, but here we assume that the contact force acts so close to the rotation axis, thatthe distance rN  0, and the torque of the force is zero"
"For no wind (w = 0), the z-component of the net torque is therefore:τ netz = τz,G + τz,N + τz,D = −MgL sin θ − DL3|ω|ω "
 (16
37)And Newton’s second law for rotational motion gives:I α = τ netz = −MgL sin θ − DL3|ω|ω

"38)The moment of inertia, I , can be related to the moment of inertia of a sphere aroundits center of mass, I cm = 2/5M R2 (from Fig"

5) using the parallel-axis theorem:I = I cm + M L2 
"Solve: While you may be able to solve the motion of the pendulum for a limitedrange of motion for small θ, we concentrate here on the general numerical approach"
"Without WindWhen there is no wind, the motion is determined from (16"

3 Rotational Motion Around a Moving Center of MassFigure 16
12 shows a rod being thrown across the lecture hall
 After it has beenthrown it is just affected by gravity and air resistance
 We know that the motion ofthe center of mass of the object only depends on the external forces acting on theobject—its motion is determined from Newton’s second law of motion
 But whatabout the rotational motion around the center of mass? The rotational motion aroundthe center of mass for a ridig body (rotating around a fixed axis) is determined fromNewton’s second law for rotational motion around the center of mass
 (A proof isfound in Sect
 A
"11)Newton’s Second Law of Translational MotionThe motion of the center of mass of a rigid body, such as the rotating rod in Fig"
 16
12is determined from Newton’s second law for translational motion:∑jFextj = MA 
 (16
43)This is true irrespective of how the system moves relatively to the center of mass
This means that the motion of the center of mass of the rod in Fig
 16
12 would bethe same if the rod rotated or if it moved with the same angle all the time

" Right Free-body diagram for therodthe external forces are the same! If we include the effects air resistance, the externalforces depend on whether the rod is rotating or not, and the motion would not beexactly the same in the two situation"
"Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion Around the Center of MassFor a system rotating around a fixed axis through the center of mass, the rotationalmotion is determined by Newton’s second law for rotational motion around the centerof mass, which is just like Newton’s second law for rotation around a fixed axis, butnow all the torques must be taken around the center of mass:τ cm = rcm × F , (16"
44)where rcm is a vector from the center of mass to the point where the force F acts
"Using this notation, we get:Newton’s second law for a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis throughthe center of mass (the z-axis) is:∑jτz,cm, j = τ netz,cm = I z,cm αz , (16"
"45)where τ cm, j is the torque of force j around the center of mass, and I z,cm isthe moment of inertia (the rotational inertia) of the object around the fixedrotational axis through its center of mass"
It may be confusing to call the axis fixed if it is moving along with the center of mass
What we mean is that the axis has a fixed direction: The direction of the rotation axis16

" When the rod is in contact with the floor(middle three insets) both gravity and a contact force from the floor actdoes not change during the motion, but the position of the axis follows the centerof mass"
 The application of the law is illustrated in Fig

" Here, we follow arod thrown across the lecture hall also during its collision with the floor"
 The smallinsets at the bottom shows the forces acting on the rod at five different time steps
"When the rod is not in contact with the floor, the only external force acting is gravity(we ignore air resistance), and since gravity acts in the center of mass, the torque ofgravity around the center of mass is zero, and the angular acceleration is thereforezero: The rod rotates with a constant angular velocity"
" However, when the rod is incontact with the floor, as illustrated in the middle three insets, the contact force Ffrom the floor on the rod gives rise to a net torque around the center of mass, whichleads to an angular acceleration during the contact"
" The force F acts at the point rcmrelative to the center of mass of the rod, giving rise to a torque: τ = rcm × F aroundthe center of mass"

 Find themotion of the ball during and after the kick
 You may neglect the effects of frictionand air resistance
"Approach: We plan to use Newton’s second law of motion to find the motion ofthe center of mass from the external forces acting, and Newton’s second law forrotational motion around the center of mass to find the rotational motion around thecenter for the ball during and after the kick"
"Identify: We assume that the ball behaves as a rigid body and describe its motionby the position, R(t) of its center of mass and its angle θ(t) around the z-axis"
 Theball starts from rest: R(0 s) = 0 and θ(0 s) = 0
Model: The translational and rotational motion depends on the external forces acting
"The ball is affected by gravity, G = −Mg k, acting at the center of mass, hencerG,cm = 0; the normal force N = N k from the ground, acting at rN ,cm = −R k;and the force F = F i from the foot, acting at rF,cm = −x i + y j, where x and yare given"
" All the positions are relative to the center of mass, since the acting pointsof the forces will move with the center of mass as the ball starts moving"
 The forcesare illustrated in Fig
 16

We apply Newton’s second law to find the motion of the center of mass:∑jFextj = −Mg k + N k + F i = MA 
 (16
"46)Since the applied force F only acts in the x-direction, we assume that the ball doesnot move in the y or z-directions"
" Therefore, the acceleration in the z-direction iszero and N = Mg"
" The motion in the x-direction is given by:M A x = Fx ⇒ A x = FxM , (16"

3 Rotational Motion Around a Moving Center of Mass 509starting from Vx = 0 m/s and X = 0 m at t = 0 s
" Notice that the motion of thecenter of mass does not depend on the rotational motion of the ball, since (16"
"47)and the time, Δt, the force is acting does not depend on either the angle θ or theangular velocity ω of the ball!The rotational motion of the ball is found from Newton’s second law for rotationalmotion around a fixed axis around the center of mass"
" (How do we know the ballrotates around a fixed axis? We know, since the direction of the torque does notchange during the motion—this is an advanced point we will return to later in thechapter"
" For now you should consider this an assumption):∑jτz,cm, j = I α , (16"
"48)where the net torque around the center of mass is:∑jτ cm, j = rG,cm × G + rN ,cm × N + rF,cm × F= 0 × G − Rk × N k + (−xi + yj) × Fi= 0 − N R (k × k)︸ ︷︷ ︸=0− x F (i × i)︸ ︷︷ ︸=0+ F y (j × i)︸ ︷︷ ︸=−k= −y Fk ,(16"

"48) gives:τ netz,cm = −y Fx = I α ⇒ α = − y FxI , (16"
50)where θ(0 s) = 0 and ω(0 s) = 0 rad/s
Solve: Both the translational and the rotational motion occur with constant accelera-tions
 We can therefore solve by direct integration to find the positions and velocities
"First, we find the velocities:Vx (t) = Vx (0)︸ ︷︷ ︸=0+∫ t0A x dt =∫ t0FM dt = FM t , (16"
51)andω(t) = ω(0)︸︷︷︸=0+∫ t0α dt =∫ t0− y FI dt = − y FI t

53)andθ(t) = θ(0)︸︷︷︸=0+∫ t0ω(t) dt =∫ t0− y FI t dt = − 12y FI t2 
 (16
"54)However, this solution is only valid as long as the ball is affected by the force F,which only is for a time interval Δt"
" After that, the ball is not affected by the forceF, and the net force in the x-direction is zero and the net torque is zero"
" Thereforethe translational and the rotational accelerations are zero, and the ball continue withthe same translational and rotational velocities:V (t) = V (Δt) = FM Δt when t > Δt , (16"
55)andω(t) = ω(Δt) = − y FI Δt when t > Δt 
 (16
"56)Since the motion for t > Δt occurs with constant translational and angular velocities,it is easy to find the position at a time t > Δt by integration:X (t) = X (Δt) + V (Δt)(t − Δt) when t > Δt , (16"
57)andθ(t) = θ(Δt) + ω(Δt)(t − Δt) when t > Δt 
 (16
58)Analyze: We notice that the motion of the center of mass does not depend on y—theposition where the force is acting
" For any choice of y, the effect on the motion ofthe center of mass is the same"
 But the rotational motion depends on y
" In particular,we notice that when y = 0, that is when the force acts on an axis through the centerof mass, the net torque is zero, and the ball does not start to rotate"
" We also noticethat if we kick the ball on the left side, with y > 0, the ball rotates in the negativedirection, whereas if we kick the ball on the right side, with y < 0, the ball rotatesin the positive direction, which is consistent with our experience with kicking balls"
This is how you give them spin
Comment: Notice that the translational and rotational motions are independent inthis case
 Why? Because the force acts at a constant distance y from the centerof mass throughout the motion
 Therefore the torque of F does not depend on the16
"3 Rotational Motion Around a Moving Center of Mass 511position of the ball, and similarly, the direction or magnitude of F does not dependon the rotation of the ball"
 This is not always the case: In many cases the two motionsare coupled because the force acting on the object depend either on the position ofthe object or on its rotation
 But in this particular case—as well as in many cases intypical mechanics exam problems—the two motions are not coupled

"Model: The object is affected by a normal force, N = N j, acting at rN ,cm = −R j;a friction force, f = − f i, acting at r f,cm = −R j; and a gravitational force G actingat the center of mass, rG,cm = 0"
 We decompose the gravitational force in the chosencoordinate system:G = Mg sin φ i − Mg cos φ j

 (16

 (16
"65)We now have 2 equations, (16"
61) and (16
"65), but 3 unknowns, A x , α, and f "
 Howdo we proceed?The main challenge in this problem lies in the friction force
" In the case wherethe friction is dynamic, that is, if the object is sliding relative to the surface, themagnitude of the friction force is simply proportional to the normal force, and thedirection is determined from the local relative velocity of the two surfaces in contact"
"However, if the object does not slide, the friction force is a static friction force, andits magnitude must be determined from other principles"
Let us first assume that the object is not sliding relative to the surface
 This meansthat the object is rolling without slipping
" The rolling condition is that there is norelative velocity at the contact point, P, vP = 0, wherevP = V + vP,cm = V + ω × rP,cm = Vx i + ω k × (−R j) = (Vx + ωR) i ,(16"
66)16
"3 Rotational Motion Around a Moving Center of Mass 513and the condition v p = 0 therefore gives Vx = −ωR, which is usually calledthe rolling condition"
" Taking the time derivative gives a similar expression for theaccelerations: A x = −Rα, which we insert this into (16"
"65), getting:f = − IR α = − IR−A xR = IR2 A x "
 (16
67)The static friction force must have this value to ensure that there is no slippingbetween the object and the surface
 We insert this result into (16
"61), giving:Mg sin φ − f︸︷︷︸=(I /R2)A x= M A xMg sin φ =(1 + IM R2)M A x ,(16"
68)andA x = g sin φ1 + IM R2
 (16
69)We introduce c = I /(M R2) to simplify the expression:A x = 11 + c g sin φ 
 (16
70)The number c depends on the distribution of mass around the rotation axis
" For asphere, c = 2/5, for a cylinder c = 1/2, and for a ring, c = 1"
The friction force is:f = IR2 A x = Mg sin φIM R21 + IM R2= Mg sin φ c1 + c 
 (16
"71)It is clear that the friction force f increases with φ, and at the same time N decreaseswith φ"
" When will the friction force reach the static friction threshold? The objectsstarts to slip at the critical angle φc when f = μs N , where we now insert the valueswe found for f and N , getting:Mg sin φcc1 + c = μs Mg cos φc ⇒ tan φc = μs1 + cc "
 (16
72)The critical angle φc depends on the number c—it will therefore depend on the typeof object rolling
" For a few characteristic objects we have:514 16 Dynamics of Rigid BodiesObject I tan φcSphere (2/5)m R2 (7/2)μsCylinder (1/2)m R2 3μsRing m R2 2μsA sphere will therefore roll down a steeper slope than a cylinder, which will startslipping at a lower angle than the sphere"
"What happens if the slope is steeper than φc? In this case the object will stillrotate, but it will not roll without slipping"
 This means that the rolling condition isno longer valid
" Instead the friction force is now the dynamic friction force, whichonly depends on the normal force:f = μd N = μd Mg cos φ "
 (16
"73)We insert this into Newton’s second law for translational motion, (16"
"61), getting:Mg sin φ − μd Mg cos φ = M A x , (16"
74)which allows us to determine A x independently of the rotational motion:A x = g (sin φ − μd cos φ) 
 (16
"75)However, the object will still rotate, since the torque around the center of mass is:τz = −R f = −Rμd Mg cos φ = I α "
 (16
76)The angular acceleration is therefore:α = − R fI = −μdR Mg cos φI

3 Example: Bouncing RodIn this example we will develop a model for a bouncing rigid rod
 The model willbe similar to the bouncing an rotating dumbbell model in Chap
" 13, but we will nowmodel a rigid rod, so there are no internal vibrations, and we will use our newlygained knowledge of how to model rotating rigid object for our model"
"The rod is of length L = 1 m, mass M = 0"
"5 kg, and has a moment of inertiaI = (1/12)M L2 around its center of mass"
" We describe the rod by the position R(t)of its center of mass and the angular orientiation θ(t), where we assume that the rodmoves in the x y-plane and rotates around an axis through the center of mass directedalong the z-axis"

16 Illustration of the rod bouncing on the floor and free-body diagram for the rodThe motion of the rod is determined by the forces acting on it
" The rod is affectedby gravity, G = −Mg j, acting at the center of mass, rG,cm = 0"
 In addition therod will bounce on the floor
" We model the force between the floor and the rod asa spring force, representing the deformation of the floor and the rod"
" If either endof the rod is pressed into the floor, that is, if the y-coordinate of either end is belowy = 0, which is the position of the floor, there will be a spring force acting normalto the floor, in the positive y-direction, which depends on how far the end of the rodhas been pressed down into the floor"
" The two ends of the rod are at positions:rA = R + (L/2) ˆu , (16"
"78)rB = R − (L/2) ˆu , (16"
"79)where ˆu = cos θ i + sin θ j is a unit vector pointing along the rod, as illustrated inFig"
 16

" The normal force, NA, due to the interaction between end A of the rod is:NA ={ −ky A when y A < 00 when y A ≥ 0 "
 (16
80)and similarly for end B:NB ={ −ky B when y B < 00 when y B ≥ 0 
 (16
"81)Here, k is the spring constant for the interaction between the rod and the floor"
"The motion of the rod is determined from Newton’s second law for translationaland rotational motion:∑jF j = G + NA + NB = MA , (16"
"82)516 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodiesand∑jτz,cm, j = I α , (16"

 (16
"84)Here, rA,cm = (L/2) ˆu and rB,cm = −(L/2) ˆu"
" Notice that both the net force andthe net torque depends on both the position of the center of mass and on the angle,since the contact force between the rod and the floor depends on the position andorientiation of the rod"
"Numerical: It is not simple to solve these equations analytically, but it is straightforward to implement a numerical solution"
" We use an Euler-Cromer scheme tointegrate both the translational and the rotational motion, simultaneously:V(t + Δt) = V(t) + A(t, R(t), θ(t)) ΔtR(t + Δt) = R(t) + V(t + Δt) Δtω(t + Δt) = ω(t) + α(t, R(t), θ(t)) Δtθ(t + Δt) = θ(t) + ω(t + Δt) Δt ,(16"

4 Collisions and Conservation LawsIf a meteor collides with a planet (see Fig
 16
"18), the planet may gain both transla-tional and rotational motion after the collision"
" We have already found that conser-vation principles, such as the conservation of translational momentum, allow us todetermine the translational motion of the planet after the collision without knowingthe details of the interactions during the collision"
" Can we find similar concepts andconservation laws for rotational motion—a rotational momentum and a conservationlaw for rotational motion—which we can use to address the rotational motion of asystem during a collision? Here, we introduce the concept of rotational momentumfirst for a point particle, then for a system of many particles, and finally for a rotatingrigid body, before we put all the pieces together and formulate a set of general prin-ciples allowing us to address collisions between several rigid, rotating object—suchas during a meteor impact or during a pirouette"
"Rotational Momentum for a Point ParticleWe have already found that the translational momentum, p, is a useful concept toaddress collisions"
 This is based on the prominent place of translational momentumin Newton’s second law:∑jF j = dpdt 
 (16
86)Fig
 16
18 A meteor impact on a planet may change both the translational and the rotational motionof the planet
 The arrows show the translational momentum and the blue dot shows the rotationalstate of the planet after the collision16
"4 Collisions and Conservation Laws 519It is indeed this law that justifies the conservation law: When the net external forceis zero, the time derivative of the translational momentum is zero and thereforeconserved throughout the process"
" Let us see if we can justify a similar concept forrotational motion, based on Newton’s second law for rotational motion:τ net = ∑jr j × F j "
 (16
"87)If we study the motion of a point particle, all the torques act in the same point, r, andthe net torque is:τ net = ∑jr × F j = r × ∑jF j = r × Fnet , (16"
88)where we can insert Fnet from Newton’s second law in (16
86):τ net = r × dpdt 
 (16
89)In order to get something that looks like Newton’s second law in (16
"86), we try tomove the time derivative out in front of r × p: What does this give?ddt (r × p) = drdt × p + r × dpdt = v × mv︸ ︷︷ ︸=0+r × dpdt = r × dpdt "
 (16
90)Yes! Success! We can therefore rewrite (16
89) as:τ net = ddt (r × p) = ddt l 
 (16
"91)This equation looks just like Newton’s second law—we have found what we havelooking for, l = r × p is the rotational analogue for translational momentum"
" Wecall l the rotational momentum or the angular momentum :lO = r × p (Rotational momentum) , (16"
"92)where we use the subscript O to show that the rotational momentum is found withrespect to the point O, and the vector r is found relative to O"
 We say that lO is therotational momentum around the point O or around an axis z (if the particular pointalong the axis is not important)
Properties of Rotational Momentum• Rotational momentum is a vector
" For planar motion, the rotational momentumis normal to the plane"
• The rotational momentum is calculated relative to a point—just like torque
 It willbe different if we choose a different point

 16
"19, the velocity v is always normal to the position r, and the rotational momen-tum around the origin at the center of the rotational motion is:l = r × mv = rmv k "
 (16
"93)The rotational momentum can be defined for any moving point particle, not only fora rotating point particle"
" For example, the rotational momentum of a particle movingalong a straight line at x = b, r = b i + y(t) j, is:l = r × mv = (b i + y(t) j) × v y j = bv y k "
 (16
94)As illustrated in Fig
 16
"19 this means that it is only the component of r that is normalto v that contributes to the rotational momentum, similar to what we previously foundfor torques"
"Newton’s Second Law for Rotational Motion of a Point ParticleWe have found an alternative formulation of Newton’s second law for a point particle,most useful for rotational motion, but valid for any motion:τ net = ddt l , (16"
95)Conservation of Rotational MomentumBased on Newton’s second law in (16
"95) we see that for a point particle, the rotationalmomentum, l, is conserved if the net external torque is zero! While this can be usedto address problems with a single particle, it first becomes really useful when weintroduce similar concepts for a rigid body or a system of many particles"

"1 Example: Block on a Frictionless TableProblem: A block of mass m is attached to a thin, massless rope passing through ahole in a frictionless table"
 The block starts with the angular velocity ω0 at a distancer0 from the hole
 We pull slowly in the rope until it reaches the radius r with theangular velocity ω
 Find ω
"Identify: As long as the rope is tight, the block moves in a circular path with radiusr"
" We describe the position of the block by the radius r and its angle θ, as illustratedin Fig"
 16
20
"Model: First, we find the forces acting on the block"
" The block is affected by gravity,G, and the normal force, N, from the table"
" Since the block is not moving in thevertical direction, the net vertical force is zero, and since two forces are acting inthe same point, the net torque of the two forces (around any point) is also zero"
" Inaddition, the block is affected by the rope tension, T"
We use Newton’s second law for rotational motion to determine the motion of theblock
" The torque around the origin of the rope tension is:τ T = r × T = 0 , (16"
96)because the force and the position vector are parallel
 This means that the net torquearound the origin is zero
" Newton’s second law for rotational motion therefore givesthat:dldt = τ = 0 , (16"
97)the rotational momentum is therefore constant throughout the motion
" The rotationalmomentum for the block is:l = r × mv , (16"
"98)where the velocity is normal to the radius vector at all times, therefore:l = rmv˛"
 (16
"99)522 16 Dynamics of Rigid BodiesWe can replace the velocity by the angular velocity, using v = Rω:l = mr2ω˛, (16"
100)which is what we found above for circular motion
"Analyze: Since the rotational momentum is conserved, we can relate the initial andfinal states"
" Initially, the rotational momentum is:l0 = mr20 ω0˛"
 (16
101)When the radius is r and the angular velocity ω:l = mr2ω˛
 (16
102)Since l = l0 we find ω:mr20 ω0 = mr2ω ⇒ ω = r20r2 ω0 
 (16
103)This demonstrates the use of the conservation principle for rotational momentum
"Rotational Momentum for a System of ParticlesThe rotational momentum of a system of particles around a fixed point, O, is thesum of the rotational momentum of each particle"
" For a system consisting of pointmasses, m i , located at points, ri , the total rotational momentum is:LO = ∑ilO,i = ∑iri × pi = ∑iri × m i vi "
 (16
"104)Similarly, we define the rotational momentum of a system of particles around theircenter of mass asLcm = ∑ilO,i = ∑ircm,i × pi = ∑ircm,i × m i vi , (16"
"105)where rcm,i is the position of mass m i relative to the center of mass"
" The rotationalmomentum of a system around a fixed axis O can also be decomposed into therotational momentum of the center of mass around O, assuming the center of massmoves as a point particle, and the rotational momentum of the system around itscenter of mass:LO = R × P + Lcm , (16"

 The internal forces cancel as longas they are central forces

 This law is general and powerful
" You will findit used frequently both theoretically, as basis for derivations, and practically, as abasis for the use of conservation laws"
" The law also demonstrates that as long as thetorque of the external forces are constant, around a fixed point O or the center ofmass, the corresponding total rotational momentum does not change"
 This is the lawfor rotational motion we have been looking for

 (16
113)Hmm
" How do we simplify this equation? If we only are interested in the z-componentof the rotational momentum (which we typically are when we use Newton’s secondlaw for rotational motion of a rigid body), we see that it is only the ρi component ofri that contributes to the z-component of LO :LO,z k = ∑im i ρi × (ωk × ρi ) = ∑im i ρ2i ωk , (16"
"114)because the vectors ρi and vi are normal to each other, and the vectors ρi and ω arenormal to each other"
" Therefore:L O,z =(∑im i ρ2i)ω = I z ω , (16"
"115)where we recognize the moment of inertia (rotational inertia), I z , around the z-axis"

"116)where I z is the moment of inertia of the object around the z-axis, and ω is theangular velocity around the z-axis"
We can use this result also for a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis through itscenter of mass

" Similarly, the expression L O,z = I z ωis only valid for rotation around a fixed axis, and it is only valid in the z-axis"
 Butwould it not be nice if the expression was completely general:LO = I ω 
 (16

" However, this expression is not generallycorrect if I is interpreted as a scalar such as I z "
 (You can see a proof in Sect

 Wecan only use the expression in (16
118) when the rigid body is rotationally symmetricaround the z-axis
" However, our results for the z-component, L O,z = I z ω, of therotational momentum of a rigid body are always true—as long as the body is rotatingaround a fixed axis"
"Putting It All TogetherFinally, we want to put all these results together to address processes where we canuse conservation of rotational momentum to solve a problem without determiningthe details of the motion"
"Redistribution of MassAn example of a typical process where we can use conservation of rotational momen-tum, is the redistribution of mass within a rotating system"
" For example, if a skaterperforming a piruoutte pulls in his arms, he changes the distribution of mass, andtherefore the moment of inertia around the rotation axis"
" Since the external forceshave no significant torque around the rotation axis, the rotational momentum is con-served throughout the process:L O,z (t0) = I z (t0)ω(t0) = L O,z (t1) = I z (t1)ω(t1) "
 (16
"119)If you change the distribution of mass, you change I z "
" To keep the rotational momen-tum constant, you must change the angular velocity correspondingly"
 Pulling yourarms in while spinning reduces I z 
 As a result the angular velocity will increase
Collision with Rotation Around a Fixed AxisAnother example of a typical process where we can use conservation of rotationalmomentum is a collision where the bodies after the collision rotate as one rigid bodyaround a fixed axis
" If the external torques acting on the bodies are insignificant, therotational momentum around the fixed axis is conserved:L O,z (t0) = L O,z (t1) = I z (t1)ω(t1) , (16"

"Since Newton’s second law for rotational motion comes in two forms: for rotationaround an axis that is fixed in space and for rotation around the center of mass, wemust be careful to check what version is revelant in a given case"
" Notice that for afixed axis, a typical error is to assume that the net force is zero because the net torqueis zero"
" Unfortunately, this is generally wrong"
 In the case illustrated in Fig
 16
"22you cannot ignore the force from the axis on the rotating object, and the translationamomentum is therefore not conserved, while the rotational momentum is conserved"
"However, if the bodies are free to move, such as when a planet is hit by a meteor asillustrated in Fig"
 16
"22, the net external force is zero, and the translational momentumis conserved"
 You must therefore carefully address the net external force and the netexternal torque in each situation

23 Left A person on a spinning disk increases his angular velocity by pulling himself closerto the rotation axis
" Right A diver changes her angular velocity around the center of mass by curlingup, but that does not affect the path taken by the center of mass significantlyis therefore conserved"
" When you pull yourself towards the rotation axis, you arechanging how the mass is distributed"
" You moment of inertia around the rotation axisis approximately I z = M R2 , where R is the distance from you to the axis (if youwere a single point)"
" Conservation of rotational momentum then gives:L z (t0) = I z (t0)ω0 = L z (t1) = I z (t1)ω1 , (16"

"122)where ω0 is your initial angular velocity when you are at a distance R0 from the pole,andω1 = R20R21ω0 , (16"
123)is the angular velocity you getting
" Pulling yourself towards the pole, makes R1 < R0and therefore ω1 > ω0 : You speed up!Similarly, if you start your dive with a small angular velocity ω0 around yourcenter of mass when your body is approximately stretched out in its full length, youcan increase your angular velocity, by pulling your body closer towards the centerof mass, decreasing your moment of inertia around the center of mass:I cm,z (t0)ω(t0) = I cm,z (t1)ω(t1) "
 (16
"124)By stretching out again, you can decrease your angular velocity, effectively allowingyou to determine how fast you spin"

"4 Collisions and Conservation Laws 529center of mass: The path taken by your center of mass is determined by the externalforces acting on you, gravity and air resistance, and gravity is not affected by yourredistribution of mass"
 Therefore you will typically follow the same path irrespec-tively of how you spin during your dive
 (There may be small differences becauseair resistance will depend both on your spin and on how your body is curled up)

3 Example: Conservation of Rotational MomentumProblem: A fly of mass m lands at the outer rim of a spinning DVD
" The disk hasmass M and radius R, and rotates with the angular velocity ω0 before the event"
 Findthe angular velocity of the plate after the fly has landed
 (You can assume that the flyis able to grip onto and remain attached to the plate
")Solution: The system consists of two objects: The DVD and the fly, as illustrated inFig"
 16
24
 We choose the fixed rotational axis through the center of the DVD as theorigin
We plan to use conservation of rotational momentum to solve the problem
" Theexternal forces on the system consiting of the DVD and the fly, are the gravitationalforces on the disk and the fly, and the force on the disk acting in the attachmentpoint at the center of the disk"
" The gravitational force on the disk and the forces onthe disk from the attachment point in the axis do not contribute to the net torquearound the axis, since the “arm”, r, is zero for these forces"
" The torque due to thegravitational force on the fly acts in the x y-plane, and its z-component is thereforezero"
" The z-component of the net torque on the system is therefore zero, and rotationalmomentum is conserved:L O,z (t0) = L O,z (t1) , (16"

"After the landing, the fly is moving with the same velocity as the disk"
" The fly hastherefore effectively changed the moment of inertia of the spinning disk, by addinga mass m at a distance R from the axis:I z (t1) = I z (t0) + m R2 , (16"
"127)and the rotational momentum of the disk-fly system is:L0,z (t1) = (I z + m R2)ω1 , (16"
"128)Now, we can find the final angular velocity, since the rotational momentum is con-served:I z ω0 =(I z + m R2)ω1 , (16"

 (16
"130)Since the disk is a cylinder, we know that the moment of inertia around the center ofthe disk (the center of mass) is: I z = M R2/2"

4 Example: Ballistic PendulumThis problem is a classic in mechanics
 It illustrates the conservation of angularmomentum during a collision
Problem: A thin rod of length L and mass M is hanging from a point O at one endof a the rod
" A bullet of mass m is shot horizontally into the rod, and hits the rodwith the horizontal velocity v at the lower end of the rod"
 The bullet is stuck in therod
 Find the angular velocity of the object immediately after the collision
Approach: We divide the problem into two parts: The collision and the subsequentmotion
 During the collision we try to use conservation of rotational momentum to16

 For the subsequent motion we use energyconsiderations to find how high the pendulum swings
Identify: We use the rotation axis as the origin
" The bullet has an initial velocityv0 = v i, and the rod is initially hanging straight down, with no angular velocity"
 Thesystem is shown in Fig
 16
25
"Model: The net external force is not zero throughout the collision, since the rodis affected by forces acting in the axis"
" What about the net torque around O? Theexternal forces acting on the system is the force, N, acting on the axis, rN = 0;the gravitational force, G of the rod; and the gravitational force Gb of the bullet"
We assume that the rod does not move much during the collision
" Consequently,the gravitational force on the rod acts approximately in the point rG = −L/2 jthroughout the collision, and similarly that the gravitational force on the bullet actsin rb = −L j"
" Also, we assume that the rod is thin, so that the bullet is at x b = 0throughout the collision—therefore, we do not have to address the horizontal positionof the bullet when we calculate the torques"
" The net external torque is therefore:τ net = 0 × N + rG × G + rb × Gb , (16"
"132)where all the terms are zero! Hence the net torque is zero, and the rotational momen-tum around the point O is conserved throughout the collision"
"We find the z-component of the total rotational momentum using the superpositionprinciple, summing the z-component of the rotational momentum of the rod and thebullet"
" For the rod, L RO,z = I z ω, which is zero before the collision when the rodstarts at rest"
" Immediately before the collision, the angular momentum of the bulletaround the point O is:LbO = rb × mv = −L j × mv0 i = Lmv k , (16"
"133)532 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodiesand the z-component is:L bO,z = Lmv "
 (16
"134)The total z-component of the angular momentum of the system immediately beforethe collision is therefore:L0,z = Lmv︸︷︷︸bullet+ I ω0︸︷︷︸rod= Lmv "
 (16
"135)After the collision, the bullet is attached to the rod and the bullet-rod system rotatesas a rigid body around the axis"
" The z-component of the rotational momentum ofa rigid body is L z = Itotω, where I is the moment of inertia"
" We find the momentof inertia of the bullet-rod system using the superposition principle, summing themoment of inertia of the rod, I , and the bullet, which we consider to be a particle ofmass m at a distance L from the rotation axis:Itot = I + m L2 "
 (16
"136)The rotational momentum after the collision is therefore:L O,z =(I + m L2)ω , (16"
137)Solve: Conservation of angular momentum gives:Lmv =(I + m L2)ω ⇒ ω = LmvI + m L2 
 (16
138)Analyze: The subsequent motion of the rod-bullet pendulum can be determined fromNewton’s second law for rotation around the axis O

5 Example: Rotating RodProblem: A thin rod of length L and mass M is lying at rest on a frictionless surface
"A bullet of the same mass, M, is shot horizontally into the rod, and hits the rod withthe horizontal velocity v at a distance y from the center of the rod"
 The bullet is stuckin the rod
 Find the translational and angular velocity of the object immediately afterthe collision
"Approach: Since the system is not affected by any external forces, the translationaland rotational momentum is conserved, and we can use conservation laws to relatethe motion before and after the collision"
16

" Thebullet is of the same mass asthe rod, and the bulletremains stuck on the rodafter the collision"
 The centerof mass during the collisionis illustratedOvLθcmcmyxMyIdentify: The system consists of the rod and the bullet
 We describe the motion of thesystem by the motion of its center of mass and by the rotation of the system aroundits center of mass
 The system is illustrated in Fig
 16
26
Model: The motion of the system is determined by the external forces acting on thesystem
" Since we can ignore frictional forces in the plane of motion, the only externalforces acting are the gravitational force and the normal force from the surface"
" Sincethe rod is not moving vertically, the net external forces are zero"
" From Newton’ssecond law for translational motion, this means that the (translational) momentumis conserved throughout the collision and during the motion afterwards:∑jFextj = ddt P = MA = 0 "
 (16
"139)The center of mass of the system therefore moves with a constant velocity—before,during, and after the collision! Notice that the translational motion does not dependon where the bullet hits the rod—the velocity of the center of mass is the sameindependently of where the bullet hits, although the position of the center of mass ofcourse will depend on where the bullet hits"
"The velocity of the center of mass before the collision depends on the velocity ofthe objects: The velocity of the rod is, vr = 0, and the velocity of the bullet is v,hence:(M + M) V = Mv + M0 = Mv , (16"
140)and therefore:V = 12 v = 12 v i 
 (16
"141)Since the system has no velocity component in the y-direction, the y-position of thecenter of mass remains constant, with the following value:534 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies(M + M) Y = M 0 − M y ⇒ Y = −y/2 , (16"
142)as illustrated in Fig
 16
26
"Second, we determine the motion relative to the center of mass"
" The rod may startrotating, depending on where the bullet hits the rod"
 The rotational motion aroundthe center of mass is related to the torque of the external forces around the centerof mass
" But, since there are no external forces acting in the plane of motion, thez-component of the external torque is zero:τ ext = 0 "
 (16
"143)We apply Newton’s second law for rotational motion around the center of mass:τ ext = ddt Lcm = 0 , (16"
144)and find that there is no change in the rotational momentum around the center of mass:The rotational momentum around the center of mass of the system is conserved
" Thisis also the case for the z-component of the rotational momentum around the centerof mass:τ extz = ddt L cm,z = 0 "
 (16
"145)Since we know the rotational momentum around the center of the mass before thecollision, we can use this to find the rotational momentum around the center of massafter the collision, and from this we find the angular velocity of the object aroundthe center of mass"
"The rotational momentum around the center of mass is the sum of the rotationalmomentum for each of the components—around their common center of mass,Lcm = Lrod + Lbullet "
 (16
"146)Before the collision, the rotational momentum of the rod around the center of massis 0, since it is not rotating initially"
" The rotational momentum of the bullet dependson the position rb,cm of the bullet relative the center of mass:Lbullet = rb,cm × Mv i = (x b,cm i + yb,cm j) × Mv i = −yb,cm Mv k "
 (16
147)Notice that only the y-component of rcm contributes
" Since the position of the bulletis −y, and the position of the center of mass is −y/2, we find that the y-componentof rb,cm is yb,cm = −y − (−y/2)) = −y/2, andL0cm,z = −(− y2)Mv = 12 Mvy "
 (16
148)16
"4 Collisions and Conservation Laws 535After the collision, the whole object, consisting of the bullet and the rod, is rotatingaround the center of mass with a rotational momentum:L1cm,z = I z ω "
 (16
"149)The total moment of inertia is:I z = Irod,z + Ibullet,z , (16"
150)where both moments of inertia must be around the same axis: The axis going throughthe center of mass of the rod-bullet system
"For the rod, the moment of inertia around its own center of mass is given inFig"
 15
"5:Irod,z,cm = 112 M L2 "
 (16
"151)The axis through the rod-bullet center of mass is a distance s = y/2 from the centerof mass of the rod, which we use in the parallel-axis theorem to find:Irod,z = Irod,z,cm + M( L2)2= 112 M L2 + M y24 "
 (16
"152)For the bullet, we assume it is a point particle, located at a distance s = y/2 fromthe center of mass, hence the parallel-axis theorem gives:Ibullet,z = M( y2)2= 14 M y2 , (16"
153)The total moment of inertia is therefore:I z = 112 M L2 + 14 M y2 + 14 M y2 = M( 112 L2 + 12 y2)
 (16
"154)Finally, we find the angular velocity after the collision from:ω = L1cm,zI z=12 MvyM ( 112 L2 + 12 y2) = vy6( Ly)2+ 6"

5 General Rotational MotionSo far we have only addressed motions where the axis of rotation does not changedirection
" But Newton’s second law for rotations around a fixed point or around thecenter of mass has general applicability, it is also valid in cases where the torqueis not parallel to the angular momentum"
 Let us address what happens in this casethrough two examples
A Rotating WheelLet us assume that you are holding a spinning wheel—such as the wheel of a bike
"You are holding onto a rod through the axis of rotation, and you want to rotate theaxis by applying a pair of forces, F and −F, at the two ends of the rod"
 Let us findthe motion of the wheel due to the force pair
The system is illustrated in Fig
 16
27a
" Initially, the wheel is rotating with theangular velocity ω around the x-axis, so that the initial angular momentum aroundthe origin is:LO = I ω i , (16"
156)since the object is symmetric around this axis
ω xyzF1F2ω xyzF1F2(a) (b)Fig
 16
27 a You try to change the rotation axis of a spinning wheel by applying a pair of forces Fand −F at symmetric positions around the center of mass of the wheel
 b An illustration of the frontwheel of a bike rolling in the positive z-direction
" The wheel is rolling, rotating around the x-axis"
"As you lean towards the right, you apply a pair of forces on the axis of the wheel, as illustrated"
" Theresulting torque acts in the z-direction, causing the angular momentum to tilt towards the z-axis,rotating the wheel so that the bike turns left16"
5 General Rotational Motion 537We apply a pair of forces to the axis
" A force F1 = −F k is acting at the positionr1 = x i, and a force F2 = F k is acting at the position r2 = −x i"
" In addition, thewheel is affected by gravity, W = −mg j, and the axis is supported by two forcesbalancing the gravitational force, N1 = N2 = mg/2 j"
 The gravity and the twobalancing forces have no net torque around the center of mass of the wheel
What is the net torque around the center of mass of the system? We find:τ netcm = r1 × F1 + r2 × F2 = x i × −F k − x i × F k = −2x F j 
 (16
157)Newtons’ second law for rotational motion gives:dLOdt = τ netcm = −2x F j 
 (16
"158)The initial angular momentum is along the x-axis, in the i direction"
" After a smalltime interval Δt, the applied forces will have lead to a small tilting of the spin axis,but the axis is tilting in the direction of the y-axis, while the forces are applied alongthe z-axis"
" Is this strange? No, this is entirely consistent with the experience yougain while riding a bike"
 Consider the motion of the front wheel of your bike
" Let usassume that while you are riding forwards, the wheel is spinning around the x-axisas illustrated in Fig"
 16
27b
" If you lean towards the left, you are transferring a pairof forces to the axis of the wheel"
" Leaning to the left, you pull up on the negativeside (the side in the negative x-direction), and you push down on the positive side ofthe spinning axis"
" As a result, you apply a torque acting in the backward direction—along the z-axis on the figure, but backward"
" The rotational axis will therefore tilt inthis direction, causing the wheel to turn to the left! Leaning on your bike thereforeleads to the front wheel turning, as you surely have experienced while cycling"
A Spinning TopA spinning top is a common child’s toy
" You spin it up by you hand (or by a stringor similar device), and the top starts spinning rapidly, balancing on its bottom tip"
"The wheel not only rotates around its axis, in addition, the axis of rotation startsrotating slowly around the vertical axis"
" As the spinning wheel spins slower andslower around its own axis, its rotates faster and faster around the vertical axis"
 Whatis happnening?Let us make a simplified physical model of the spinning wheel
" We consider thewheel to be a symmetric object rotating around its axis of symmetry with an initialangular velocity ωs , as illustrated in Fig"
 16
28
" The spinning wheel is standing on atip located on the symmetry axis, and we assume that it rotates approximately withoutfriction"
" In addition, the rotation axis of the spinning wheel is rotating slowly, withan angular velocity Ω, around the vertical z-axis"
 Can we find a relation between ωsand Ω?538 16 Dynamics of Rigid BodiesγL(t)L(t+Δt)Δφ=ΩΔ tRΩ ΩωslONGL sin γγOΔLFig

28 An illustration of a spinning wheel balancing on the point O
" The wheel rotates rapidlyarounds its own axis with the angular velocity ωs , in addition, the axis rotates slowly around thevertical axis with the angular velocity ΩWe start by analyzing the situation in order to determine the motion of the spinningtop"
 Its motion is determined by the forces acting on it
" The spinning top is affected bygravity, G, and the normal force, N, as illustrated the free-body diagram in Fig"
 16
28
"We apply Newton’s second law for the motion of the center of mass:∑ Fz = N − Mg = M A z = 0 , (16"
"159)where we have assumed that the top does not move in the vertical direction, henceA z = 0"
 This means that the normal force is:N = Mg 
 (16
160)We apply Newton’s second law for rotation around the point O—the contact pointfor the axis of the spinning top
 This point is stationary—it does not move throughoutthe motion
" We find the net torque around this point at a time when the center ofmass of the spinning wheel is located along the x-axis, at the positionr = R i = Ml sin γ i , (16"
161)where we see that R = l sin γ from Fig
 16
28
 The net torque around O is therefore:τ netO = 0 × N + r × G︸︷︷︸=−Mg k= R i × (−Mg k) = −Mg R (−j) = Mg R j 
 (16
"162)What is the angular momentum of the spinning top? We notice that there are twocontributions to the angular momentum: The spinning top is rotating around its axisof symmetry, and the center of mass is moving in a circle around the vertical axis"
"We use the general expression for the angular momentum for a rigid bodyLO = R × M V︸︷︷︸=Ωk×R+ Lcm = R MΩ R k + Lcm = M R2Ω k + Icmωs , (16"
163)16
"5 General Rotational Motion 539where we have used that since the spinning top is rotating around its center of mass,the angular momentum around the center of mass is Lcm = Icmωs , where ωs pointsalong the axis of the spinning top"
" In addition, we will now assume that the angularmomentum of the rotation of the center of mass is much smaller than the angularmomentum of the rotation of the spinning mass around its center of mass:M R2Ω  Icmωs ⇒ f Ω  IcmM R2 ωs , (16"
"164)where the prefactor is of the order one, since the mass is typically located a distancesmaller than R from the center of mass"
" Consequently, we have assumed that:Ω  ωs , (16"
"165)that the spinning top is rotating much faster around its own axis, than the axis isrotating around the vertical axis"
 Our approximation is therefore:LO  Icmωs 
 (16
166)Newton’s second law for angular motion around a fixed point states:τ netO = dLOdt 
 (16
"167)Now, since we know that the axis of the spinning top is rotating around the verticalaxis with an (approximately) constant angular velocity, we know the change in angu-lar momentum around the center of mass over a small time step Δt—it is simplyfound by the change in the angular momentum vector L0 , which is (approximately)parallel to the angular momentum around the center of mass"
 The change in angularmomentum is:ΔLO = LO (t + Δt) − LO (t) 
 (16
168)From Fig
 16
"28, we see that the angular velocity vector ωs , and therefore also theangular momentum LO , rotates an angle Δφ around the vertical axis during the timeinterval Δt"
" Since the “radius” in this circle is L O sin γ , we see that the change inangular momentum is approximately equal to the arc length along the circle:ΔL O = (L O sin γ ) Δφ "
 (16
"169)We divide by Δt, getting:ΔL OΔt = L O sin γ ΔφΔt = L O sin γ Ω "
 (16
"170)540 16 Dynamics of Rigid BodiesFrom Newton’s second law for rotational motion, we know thatd L Odt = τ netO = Mgl sin γ , (16"
"171)henceL O Ω = Mgl , (16"
172)and since L O  Icmωs we find:Ω = MglL O MglIcmωs
 (16
"173)We have found a relation between the angular velocity ωs of the spinning toparound its center of mass, and the angular velocity Ω of the spinning axis around thevertical axis"
"We notice that Ω increases as ωs decreases, which “explains” the behavior ofa spinning top running on the floor: It wobbles faster as the spinning wheel slowsdown"
"However, when ωs → 0, our assumption that M R2Ω  Icmωs breaks down, andour theory is no longer valid"
" Our solution therefore only has limited applicability,and we should make a rule to always check such assumptions at the end, to find ifwe have violated them"

 This is true also whenthe center of mass is moving
"Collisions and conservation laws:• If the net torque around a fixed point O is zero (or very small) throughout acollision, then the angular momentum around this point is conserved throughoutthe collision"

5 Motion of rod during a collision-like process
 In this problem we will studythe motion of a thin rod that falls and attaches itself to a hinge
 We will look at boththe motion of the center of mass of the rod and how the rotation of the rod changesin the process
"The moment of inertia of the rod about an axis through the center of mass isI z,cm = 112 M L2 , (16"

11 Snow crystal In this project you will apply your knowledge of linear andangular momentum to study the aggregation of small droplets of ice to form largegrains of snow
As snow crystals form in clouds they start falling through the cloud
" Due to airresistance, larger particles fall faster than smaller particles"
 A large particle will there-fore overtake smaller particles
" When a smaller particle is overtaken, it will stick to thelarger particle, adding further to the size"
" This process forms aggregate snowflakes,which is one of the most common types of snowflakes"
" 3 This mechanism is oftencalled differential sedimentation, and is a process important for pattern formation inmany natural systems, and it is also a process important for many industrial processes"
An example of a complex aggregate formed by a related aggregation process calledDiffusion Limited Aggregation in Fig

"In this project, we will study the aggregation process in detail"
" We will study anapproximately spherical grain of ice of mass M and radius R, hitting and sticking toan identical grain of ice"

 We call this combination of two grains a compound grain

" Initially,it is rotating with the angular velocity ω1 "
"(i) If we ignore air resistance, find ω(t) as a function of time for the subsequentmotion"
"In the following we will not ignore air resistance, but rather develop a simplifiedmodel for the air resistance"
" In order to determine the force acting on the compoundobject due to air resistance, we either need to perform experiments on such objects,550 16 Dynamics of Rigid Bodiesor we can use numerical simulations of the fluid flow around the object to determinethe forces"
"Here, we will use a strong simplification: We assume that we may consider thecompound object to consist of two separate spheres"
 The force on each of the spheresdue to air resistance is described by (16
"176), where the corresponding velocity, v,in (16"
"176) is the velocity of the center of the sphere, and the force acts in the centerof the sphere"
The compound object has velocity vcm and angular velocity ω
"(j) Argue that the velocities, vA and vB , of each of the ice grains A and B arevA = vcm + ω × r and vB = vcm − ω × r, where r describes the position of grainA relative to the center of mass of the compound grain"
"(k) Show that the net force on the center of mass of the compound object is ∑ F =2Mg − 2k vvcm , where g = −gj and g is the acceleration of gravity"
(l) Show that the torque around the center of mass of the compound object due to airresistance is τ = −2k vωR2 (Hint: Use Lagrange’s formula)
"(m) Show that the angular acceleration α of the compound object around its center ofmass can be written as α = dω/dt = −(1/t0)ω, and find the characteristic time t0 "
(n) Describe (with words) the motion of the compound object
"(o) Sketch the time development of the velocity vcm and the angular velocity ω ofthe compound object, and discuss how the behavior would change if you changedthe radius, R, of the grains"
"(p) How would our argument change if we instead studied large particles, where theair resistance force depends on the square of the velocity?Final comment: Notice that the result above for the net force on the compoundgrain indicates that small and large grains have the same acceleration, which is notconsistent with our initial result"
 This is due to our (incorrect) simplification of addingthe air resistance force for each of the grains together to get the air resistance force forthe compound grain
" For a real ice crystal formed by aggregation, the dependenceof the air resistance on the size of the compound grain is more complicated, andwill also depend on the complex geometry attained by a compound grain after a fewhundred collisions with smaller grains"

 In this project we will study a ball that bounceson a flat surface
" We will only look at a single collision between the ball and thesurface, but we will use different models for the interactions during the collision"
"Both the ball and the surface are deformed during the collision, but you canassume that this deformation is small, this means that the forces from the surface onthe ball will only act in a single point on the ball throughout the collision, and thatthe distance from this point to the center of mass of the ball does not change"
 The ballslips against the surface during the collision and the coefficient of dynamic frictionbetween the ball and the surface is the constant μ

"34)562 Appendix A: ProofsHere, the net force on part i is the sum of the external forces acting on part i andthe internal forces"
 An internal force must originate in one of the other parts of thesystem
" We can therefore write all the internal forces as: F j,i , meaning the force frompart j on part i"
" The net force on part i is therefore:Fneti = Fexti + ∑j =iF j,i , (A"
"35)which we insert into the equations, getting:dLOdt =N∑i=1ri ×⎛⎝Fexti + ∑j =iF j,i⎞⎠ =N∑i=1ri × Fexti +N∑i=1∑j =iri × F j,i "
 (A
"36)Let us look at the last term, which is the sum of the torques on part i from all parts jin the system"
" From Newton’s third law, we know that F j,i = −Fi, j "
" Therefore, werewrite the equation so that we explicitely include action/reaction terms"
" We do thisthrough a “trick” you will often meet in physics: We realize that the sum over all theinternal torques:N∑i=1∑j =iri × F j,i , (A"
"37)is a sum over all pairs, i, j, so that i  = j"
" We could also write this as:N∑i=1∑j =iri × F j,i = ∑i, j:i = jri × F j,i , (A"
38)where the last sum is over all possible values of i and j as long as they are not equal
"However, in this sum, there are pairs of torques that are related by action/reactionforces"
" There is a torque on particle i due to the force F j,i from particle j on particlei, but there is also a torque on particle j due to the force Fi, j from particle i onparticle j"
" If we want to include both of these terms explicitely in the sum, the summust only be over half of the i and j values so that we do not include any term twice"
"We ensure this by summing over all pairs i and j so that i < j:∑i, j:i = jri × F j,i = ∑i, j:i< j(ri × F j,i + r j × Fi, j) "
 (A
"39)Appendix A: Proofs 563We now use that F j,i = −Fi, j :∑i, j:i< j(ri × F j,i + r j × Fi, j) = ∑i, j:i< j(ri × F j,i + r j × (−F j,i))= ∑i, j:i< j(ri − r j) × F j,i "

40)Hmmm
" What can we do about this sum? We realize that if the force on particle ifrom particle j acts along the line between particle i and j:F j,i = C j,i(ri − r j) , (A"
41)then the last term in (A
40) is zero
 We call such forces central forces
" In a rigidbody, we assume that all forces are central"
" However, in many other types of systemsthe forces are also central"
" For example, gravitational forces, typical two-particleinteratomic forces (given by a two-particle potential energy), and electro-static forcesare central forces: This means that many forces from the atomic to the galactic scaleare indeed central forces"
" It is therefore a reasonable assumption to assume that theforces are central forces, and that the sum of internal torques is zero"
"The rate of change of the total angular momentum of the system is therefore equalto the net external torque on the system:dLOdt =N∑i=1ri × Fexti = τ ext , (A"
42)which is what we call the net external torque around the point O

9 Rotational Momentum of a Ridig BodyWe have now found a general formulation for Newton’s second law for rotationalmotion of a multiparticle system
" However, we are often interested in rigid bodies"
"Can we simplify the relation by first finding the rotational momentum LO , of a rigidbody rotating around a fixed axis, and then use this to find a simplified expressionfor Newton’s second law for rotation of rigid bodies?First, we find the rotational momentum of a rigid body"
 Figure A

" The rigid bodyconsists of a set of mass point, m i , located at positions ri "
 The rotational momentumof this system is then:LO = ∑ili = ∑iri × m i vi

 (A
"47)We use Lagrange’s formula for the cross product:a × (b × c) = b (a · c) − c (a · b) , (A"
